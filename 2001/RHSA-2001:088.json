This is normally not a security problem; however, xloadimage\nis called by the 'plugger' program from inside Netscape to handle some\nimage types. Hence, a remote site could cause arbitrary code to be executed as\nthe user running Netscape. It is recommended that users of Netscape\nand plugger update to the fixed xloadimage packages.\n\nPlugger was shipped in Red Hat Powertools 6.2; if you have\nonly installed packages from Red Hat Linux 6.2, you are not vulnerable\nto this exploit.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
