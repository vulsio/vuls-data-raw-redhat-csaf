It is possible for a local\nmalicious user to modify the permissions of a local file if they have write\naccess to a directory in which a cpio archive is being extracted. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCVE-2005-1111 to this issue.\n\nIt was discovered that cpio uses a 0 umask when creating files using the -O\n(archive) option. This creates output files with mode 0666 (all users can\nread and write) regardless of the user's umask setting. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCVE-1999-1572 to this issue.\n\nAll users of cpio are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported fixes for these issues.",
