				"text": "The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThis is a kernel maintenance update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThe following security issues were corrected:\n\nA flaw between execve() syscall handling and core dumping of ELF-format\nexecutables allowed local unprivileged users to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-1263\nto this issue. \n\nA flaw when freeing a pointer in load_elf_library was discovered.  A local\nuser could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash).\n(CAN-2005-0749)\n\nThe Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver did not properly check the DMA\nlock, which could allow remote attackers or local users to cause a denial\nof service (X Server crash) or possibly modify the video output.\n(CAN-2004-1056)\n\nA flaw in the moxa serial driver could allow a local user to perform\nprivileged operations such as replacing the firmware. (CAN-2005-0504)\n\nThe following bug fixes were also made:\n\n- Fix a race condition that can cause a panic in __get_lease()\n- Fix a race condition that can cause a panic when reading /proc/mdstat\n- Fix incorrect ide accounting\n- Prevent non-root users from reloading moxa driver firmware\n- Fix a null-pointer-dereference bug in rpciod\n- Fix legacy-usb handoff for certain IBM platforms\n- Fix a bug that caused busy inodes after unmount\n- Provide an additional fix for a memory leak in scsi_scan_single.\n- Fix a potential kswapd/dquot deadlock.\n- Fix a potential local DoS in shmemfs.\n- Fix a random poolsize vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels to\nthe packages associated with their machine configurations as listed in this\nerratum.",
