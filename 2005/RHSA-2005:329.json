It is possible for a user to gain elevated privileges by loading a\nspecially crafted pixmap image. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2495 to this issue.\n\nUsers of XFree86 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.",
