				"text": "GDB, the GNU debugger, allows debugging of programs written in C, C++,\nand other languages, by executing them in a controlled fashion, and then\nprinting their data.\n\nThis updated package addresses the following issues:\n\n- GDB on ia64 had previously implemented a bug fix to work-around a kernel\nproblem when creating a core file via gcore.  The bug fix caused a\nsignificant slow-down of gcore.\n\n- GDB on Itanium issued an extraneous warning when gcore was used.\n\n- GDB on Itanium could not successfully do an info frame for a signal\ntrampoline.\n\n- GDB on AMD64 and Intel EM64T had problems attaching to a 32-bit process.\n\n- GDB on AMD64 and Intel EM64T was not properly handling threaded watchpoints.\n\n- GDB could not build with gcc4 when -Werror flag was set.\n\n- GDB had problems printing inherited members of C++ classes.\n\n- A few updates from mainline sources concerning Dwarf2 partial die in\ncache support, follow-fork support, interrupted syscall support, and\nDW_OP_piece read support.\n\nAll users of gdb should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.",
