				"text": "The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThis is the seventh regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThe following security updates were made:\n\nA flaw in fragment queuing was discovered that affected the Linux 2.4 and\nLinux 2.6 kernel netfilter subsystem. On systems configured to filter or\nprocess network packets (for example, those configured to do firewalling),\na remote attacker could send a carefully crafted set of fragmented packets\nto a machine and cause a denial of service (system crash). In order to\nsucessfully exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to know (or guess)\nsome aspects of the firewall ruleset in place on the target system to be\nable to craft the right fragmented packets. (CAN-2005-0449)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux PPP driver. On systems allowing remote\nusers to connect to a server using ppp, a remote client could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0384)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the bluetooth driver system. On systems where the\nbluetooth modules are loaded, a local user could use this flaw to gain\nelevated (root) privileges. (CAN-2005-0750)\n\nKeith Owens reported a flaw in the Itanium unw_unwind_to_user() function.\nA local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CAN-2005-0135)\n\nA missing Itanium syscall table entry could allow an unprivileged\nlocal user to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0137)\n\nThere were several bug fixes in various parts of the kernel. The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement\nin the reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nBug fixes for this release include:\n\n  - Fixes an incorrect test in RPC for SYN packets when reconnecting \n    an idle TCP link\n  - Fixes a memory-corruption bug in the DMA path that can cause\n    system hangs or unpredictable behavior under heavy I/O load\n  - Adds new devices to the SCSI scan list so they can\n    be initialized and handled properly: LSI ProFibre 4000R, HP \n    HSV200/210, HP MSA, STK OPENstorage D178.\n  - Fixes a hang under heavy I/O load in the qla1280 driver\n  - Fixes a panic in disk quota code\n  - Fixes a potential format overflow in /proc/partitions\n  - Fixes ipvs calls to ip_defrag()\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.\n\nPlease note that a vulnerability addressed by this update (CAN-2005-0449)\nrequired a change to the kernel module ABI which could cause third party\nmodules to not work. However, Red Hat is currently not aware of any module\nthat would be affected by this change.",
