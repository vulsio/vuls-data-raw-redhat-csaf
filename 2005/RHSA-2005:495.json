All three of\nthese commands use rhosts-style authentication.\n\nThe rcp protocol allows a server to instruct a client to write to arbitrary\nfiles outside of the current directory.  This could potentially cause a\nsecurity issue if a user uses rcp to copy files from a malicious server. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0175 to this issue.\n\nAll users of rsh should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.
