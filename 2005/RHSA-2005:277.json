The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0255 to this issue.\n\nPlease note that other security issues have been found that affect Mozilla.\nThese other issues have a lower severity, and are therefore planned to be\nreleased as additional security updates in the future.\n\nUsers of Mozilla should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch and are not vulnerable to these issues.",
