These bugs\ncould cause Midnight Commander to hang or crash if a victim opens a\ncarefully crafted file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-1009, CAN-2004-1090,\nCAN-2004-1091, CAN-2004-1093 and CAN-2004-1174 to these issues.\n\nA filename quoting bug was found in Midnight Commander's FISH protocol\nhandler. If a victim connects via embedded SSH support to a host containing\na carefully crafted filename, arbitrary code may be executed as the user\nrunning Midnight Commander. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1175 to this issue.\n\nA buffer overflow bug was found in the way Midnight Commander handles\ndirectory completion. If a victim uses completion on a maliciously crafted\ndirectory path, it is possible for arbitrary code to be executed as the\nuser running Midnight Commander. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0763 to this issue.\n\nUsers of mc are advised to upgrade to these packages, which contain\nbackported security patches to correct these issues.",
