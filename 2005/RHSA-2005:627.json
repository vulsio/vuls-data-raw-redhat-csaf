The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2103 to this issue.\n\nDaniel Atallah discovered a denial of service issue in Gaim. A remote\nattacker could attempt to upload a file with a specially crafted name to a\nuser logged into AIM or ICQ, causing Gaim to crash. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-2102 to this issue.\n\nA denial of service bug was found in Gaim's Gadu Gadu protocol handler. A\nremote attacker could send a specially crafted message to a Gaim user\nlogged into Gadu Gadu, causing Gaim to crash.  Please note that this issue\nonly affects PPC and IBM S/390 systems running Gaim. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-2370 to this issue.\n\nUsers of gaim are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.",
