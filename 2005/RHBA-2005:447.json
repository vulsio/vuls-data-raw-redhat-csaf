The permissions of the writer device are\nchanged by pam_console_apply at console login.  Setting the uid of cdrecord\nto root opens a vulnerability to possible exploitation.\n\nAll users of cdrecord that setuid root should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve this issue.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
