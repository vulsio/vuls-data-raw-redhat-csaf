It\nis possible for an attacker to create a specially crafted GIF image, which\nwhen viewed by a victim will execute arbitrary code as the victim. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0399 to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays dialog windows. It is possible\nthat a malicious web page which is being displayed in a background tab\ncould present the user with a dialog window appearing to come from the\nactive page. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1380 to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla allowed plug-ins to load privileged\ncontent into a frame. It is possible that a malicious webpage could trick a\nuser into clicking in certain places to modify configuration settings or\nexecute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0232 to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla Mail handles cookies when loading\ncontent over HTTP regardless of the user's preference. It is possible that\na particular user could be tracked through the use of malicious mail\nmessages which load content over HTTP. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0149 to\nthis issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla responds to proxy auth requests. It is\npossible for a malicious webserver to steal credentials from a victims\nbrowser by issuing a 407 proxy authentication request. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0147 to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handles certain start tags followed by a\nNULL character.  A malicious web page could cause Mozilla to crash when\nviewed by a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1613 to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla sets file permissions when installing\nXPI packages.  It is possible for an XPI package to install some files\nworld readable or writable, allowing a malicious local user to steal\ninformation or execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0906 to\nthis issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla loads links in a new tab which are\nmiddle clicked. A malicious web page could read local files or modify\nprivileged chrom settings. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0141 to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays the secure site icon. A\nmalicious web page can use a view-source URL targetted at a secure page,\nwhile loading an insecure page, yet the secure site icon shows the previous\nsecure state. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0144 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this updated package which\ncontains Mozilla version 1.4.4 and additional backported patches to correct\nthese issues.",
