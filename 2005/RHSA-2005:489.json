The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0718 to\nthis issue.\n \nA bug was found in the way Squid handles access to the cachemgr.cgi script. \nIt is possible for an authorised remote user to bypass access control\nlists with this flaw. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-1999-0710 to this issue.\n \nA bug was found in the way Squid handles DNS replies.  If the port Squid\nuses for DNS requests is not protected by a firewall, it is possible for a\nremote attacker to spoof DNS replies, possibly redirecting a user to\nspoofed or malicious content. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name  CAN-2005-1519 to this issue. \n \nAdditionally, this update fixes the following bugs:   \n - squid fails in the unpacking of squid-2.4.STABLE7-1.21as.5.src.rpm\n \nUsers of Squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues.",
