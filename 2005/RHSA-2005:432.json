It is possible\nthat a remote attacker could send a specially crafted SNAC packet to a Gaim\nclient, causing the client to stop responding. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0472\nto this issue.\n\nUsers of Gaim are advised to upgrade to this updated package which contains\ngaim version 0.59.9 with backported patches to correct these issues.",
