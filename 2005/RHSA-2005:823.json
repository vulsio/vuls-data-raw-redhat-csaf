The default behavior of fetchmailconf is to write a\nconfiguration file which may be world readable for a short period of time.\nThis configuration file could provide passwords to a local malicious\nattacker within the short window before fetchmailconf sets secure\npermissions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned\nthe name CVE-2005-3088 to this issue.\n\nUsers of fetchmail are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch which resolves this issue.",
