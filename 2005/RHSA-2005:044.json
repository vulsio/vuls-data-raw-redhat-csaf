				"category": "general",
				"text": "XFree86 is an open source implementation of the X Window System.  It\nprovides the basic low level functionality which full-fledged graphical\nuser interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in libXpm, which is used by some\napplications for loading of XPM images.  An attacker could create a\nmalicious XPM file that would execute arbitrary code if opened by a victim\nusing an application linked to the vulnerable library.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0605 to this issue.\n\nXFree86 4.1.0 was not functional on systems that did not have a legacy\nkeyboard controller (8042).  During startup, the X server would attempt to\nupdate registers on the 8042 controller, but if that chip was not present,\nthe X server would hang during startup.  This new release has a workaround\nso that the access to those registers time out if they are not present.\n\nA bug in libXaw could cause applications to segfault on 64-bit systems\nunder certain circumstances.  This has been fixed with a patch backported\nfrom XFree86 4.3.0.\n\nXlib contained a memory leak caused by double allocation, which has been\nfixed in XFree86 4.3.0 using backported patch.\n\nAll users of XFree86 should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.",
