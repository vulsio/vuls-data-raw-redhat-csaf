A local user\ncould create a carefully crafted directory structure that would prevent\nupdatedb from completing its file system scan, resulting in an incomplete\nslocate database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-2499 to this issue.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which includes a\nbackported patch to resolve this issue.",
