				"text": "The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThis is a kernel maintenance update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThe following security issues are corrected:\n\nA flaw between execve() syscall handling and core dumping of ELF-format\nexecutables allowed local unprivileged users to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-1263\nto this issue.\n\nA flaw in ptrace for Itanium architectures was discovered.  A local user\ncould use this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain\nprivileges. (CAN-2005-1761)\n\nA race condition in the ia32 compatibility code for the execve system call\nwas discovered.  A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel panic) or possibly gain privileges.  (CAN-2005-1768)\n\nA flaw when freeing a pointer in load_elf_library was discovered. A local\nuser could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash).\n(CAN-2005-0749)\n\nThe Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver did not properly check the DMA\nlock, which could allow remote attackers or local users to cause a denial\nof service (X Server crash) or possibly modify the video output.\n(CAN-2004-1056)\n\nA flaw in the moxa serial driver could allow a local user to perform\nprivileged operations such as replacing the firmware. (CAN-2005-0504) \n\nThe following bug fixes were also made:\n\n- \"busy inodes after unmount\" error on NFS volumes\n- Establish 64-bit limits even for 32-bit threads\n- Fix a race condition in __get_lease\n- Fix error in IDE disk accounting. This last fix causes IO accounting \n  to occur only on READ and WRITE operations.  This fixes several bugs \n  in various accounting and statistic utilities.\n- Fix kswapd/dquot deadlock bug\n- Fix loop control bug in do_shmem_file_read\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 Itanium users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine configurations as\nlisted in this erratum.",
