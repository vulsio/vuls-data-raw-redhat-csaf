It is possible that if a user connects to a\nmalicious CDDB server, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the\nvictim's machine.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0706 to this issue.\n\nUsers of grip should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.",
