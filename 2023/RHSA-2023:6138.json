For example, the victim's server must have an incomplete SSH server configuration by not having the \"~/.ssh/authorized_keys\" existent and also having an SSH Server Port externally accessible. So, an attacker would need, even in other scenarios, to gather configuration settings and previous knowledge about the environment in order to have a successful attack. The impact is Important as code execution might happen, but it is not guaranteed.\n\nRed Hat Fuse 7 contains plexus-archiver as a transitive dependency and does not make it vulnerable during runtime, hence the low impact.",
