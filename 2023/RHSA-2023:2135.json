In Candlepin, the Commons Text is being pulled for the Liquibase and ActiveMQ Artemis libraries as a dependency. Red Hat Product Security has evaluated and rated the impact of the flaw as Low for Satellite since there was no harm identified to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems.\n\n- The OCP has a *Moderate* impact because the affected library is a third-party library in the OCP jenkins-2-plugin component which reduces the possibilities of successful exploitation.\n- The OCP-4.8 is affected by this CVE and is in an extended life phase.
