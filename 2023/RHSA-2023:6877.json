					"text": "If the openwire protocol IS NOT in use, system operators can disable the OpenWire protocol which removes most risk of this vulnerability being exploited. If OpenWire IS being used, see the Mitigations section for potential options to reduce your attack surface.\n\n\n* How to determine if an AMQ 7 system is affected:\nCheck in the broker.xml configuration file. Notice the presence of **OPENWIRE** in the following snippet which indicates a vulnerable configuration. \n~~~\n<acceptor name=\"artemis\">tcp://localhost:####?tcpSendBufferSize=1048576;tcpReceiveBufferSize=1048576;protocols=CORE,AMQP,STOMP,HORNETQ,MQTT,**OPENWIRE**;useEpoll=true;amqpCredits=1000;amqpLowCredits=300;anycastPrefix=jms.queue.;multicastPrefix=jms.topic.</acceptor>\n~~~\n\n\n* How to determine if an AMQ 7 for OpenShift system is affected:\nGet the `ActivemqArtemis` CR yaml and review the acceptor protocol and see if the following entry is present: `(default, all, Openwire)` which indicates the system is vulnerable.\n\n\n* How to determine if a Fuse 6 system is affected:\nBy default Fuse 6 includes and enables ActiveMQ Broker. So unless this has been manually disabled, every Fuse 6 system is affected by this vulnerability.\n\n\n* How to determine if a Fuse 7 system is affected:\nFuse 7 itself is not vulnerable. By default it ships the vulnerable activemq-client jar, however it does not instantiate an ActiveMQ broker. If this feature (connect to an external ActiveMQ Broker) were manually configured, it would make it vulnerable.\n\n\n* How to determine if a Fuse Online system is affected:\nSyndesis,  an Integration Platform As A Service part of Fuse Online which runs on top of Openshift, does not use activemq code. Also, it doesn't instantiate a broker with Openwire protocol enabled, which makes it not vulnerable to this CVE.",
