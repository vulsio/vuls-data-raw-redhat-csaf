Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, from where your application consumes them. This makes it possible for your application to easily consume all of the events correctly and completely. Even if your application stops unexpectedly, it will not miss anything: when the application restarts, it will resume consuming the events where it left off.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* jdbc-postgresql: postgresql-jdbc: PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream) will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k (CVE-2022-41946) \n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
