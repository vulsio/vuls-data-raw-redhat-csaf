If OpenWire IS being used, see the Mitigations section for potential options to reduce your attack surface.\n\n\n* How to determine if an AMQ 7 system is affected:\nCheck in the broker.xml configuration file. Notice the presence of **OPENWIRE** in the following snippet which indicates a vulnerable configuration. \n~~~\n<acceptor name=\"artemis\">tcp://localhost:####?tcpSendBufferSize=1048576;tcpReceiveBufferSize=1048576;protocols=CORE,AMQP,STOMP,HORNETQ,MQTT,**OPENWIRE**;useEpoll=true;amqpCredits=1000;amqpLowCredits=300;anycastPrefix=jms.queue.;multicastPrefix=jms.topic.</acceptor>\n~~~\n\n\n* How to determine if an AMQ 7 for OpenShift system is affected:\nGet the `ActivemqArtemis` CR yaml and review the acceptor protocol and see if the following entry is present: `(default, all, Openwire)` which indicates the system is vulnerable.\n\n\n* How to determine if a Fuse 6 system is affected:\nBy default Fuse 6 includes and enables ActiveMQ Broker. So unless this has been manually disabled, every Fuse 6 system is affected by this vulnerability.\n\n\n* How to determine if a Fuse 7 system is affected:\nFuse 7 itself is not vulnerable. By default it ships the vulnerable activemq-client jar, however it does not instantiate an ActiveMQ broker. If this feature (connect to an external ActiveMQ Broker) were manually configured, it would make it vulnerable.\n\n\n* How to determine if a Fuse Online system is affected:\nSyndesis,  an Integration Platform As A Service part of Fuse Online which runs on top of Openshift, does not use activemq code. Also, it doesn't instantiate a broker with Openwire protocol enabled, which makes it not vulnerable to this CVE.",
