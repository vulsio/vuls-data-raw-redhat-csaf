The temporary directory is created in /tmp leaves the secrets unencrypted.\r\n\r\nOn Operating Systems which /tmp is not a tmpfs but part of the root partition, the directory is only cleared on boot and the decrypted data remains when the host is switched off. The system will be vulnerable when the system is not running. So decrypted data must be cleared as soon as possible and the data which normally is encrypted is sensible.",
