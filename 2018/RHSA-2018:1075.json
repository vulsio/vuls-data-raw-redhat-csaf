Instead, the Red Hat Ansible Engine product has been made available to Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions and will provide access to the official Ansible Engine channel. Customers who have previously installed Ansible and its dependencies from the Extras channel are advised to enable and update from the Ansible Engine channel, or uninstall the packages as future errata will not be provided from the Extras channel.\n\nAnsible was previously provided in Extras (for AMD64 and Intel 64 architectures, and IBM POWER, little endian) as a runtime dependency of, and limited in support to, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) System Roles. Ansible Engine is available today for AMD64 and Intel 64 architectures, with IBM POWER, little endian availability coming soon.\n\nNote that Ansible in the Extras channel was not a part of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux FIPS validation process.\n\nThe following packages have been deprecated from the Extras channel:\n\n* ansible\n* ansible-doc\n* libtomcrypt\n* libtommath\n* libtommath-devel\n* python2-crypto\n* python2-jmespath\n* python-httplib2\n* python-paramiko\n* python-paramiko-doc\n* python-passlib\n* sshpass\n\n(BZ#1533106)\n\nAdditional information and guidance are provided in the Knowledgebase article \"Ansible deprecated in the Extras channel\" linked from the References section.",
