This may result in a heap memory exhaustion, full GC, or OutOfMemoryError. (CVE-2017-12174)\n\n* A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12617)\n\n* A vulnerability was found in the way RemoteMessageChannel, introduced in jboss-remoting versions 3.3.10.Final-redhat-1, reads from an empty buffer. An attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service via high CPU caused by an infinite loop. (CVE-2018-1041)\n\nThe CVE-2017-12174 issue was discovered by Masafumi Miura (Red Hat).",
