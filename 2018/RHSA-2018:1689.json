				"text": "The rhevm-setup-plugins package adds functionality exclusive only to Red Hat Virtualization Manager, and is not available for the upstream ovirt-engine. It includes the configuration of the Red Hat Support plugin, copying downstream-only artifacts to the ISO domain, and links to the knowledgebase and other support material.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rhevm-setup-plugins (3.6.7). (BZ#1579010)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639)\n\nNote: This is the rhevm-setup-plugins side of the CVE-2018-3639 mitigation.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.",
