A remote attacker able to submit an SAXSource\ncontaining an XXE declaration could use this flaw to read files accessible\nto the user running the application server, and potentially perform other\nmore advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0263)\n\nIt was found that Apache Camel performed XML External Entity (XXE)\nexpansion when evaluating invalid XML Strings or invalid XML GenericFile\nobjects. A remote attacker able to submit a crafted XML message could use\nthis flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application\nserver, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.\n(CVE-2015-0264)\n\nA flaw was found in the dashbuilder import facility: the DocumentBuilders\ninstantiated in org.jboss.dashboard.export.ImportManagerImpl did not\ndisable external entities. This could allow an attacker to perform a\nvariety of XML External Entity (XXE) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\nattacks. (CVE-2015-1818)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank David Jorm of IIX Product Security for\nreporting the CVE-2015-1818 issue.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2.",
