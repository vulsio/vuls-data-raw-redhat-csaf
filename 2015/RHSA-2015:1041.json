It includes several bug fixes, which are documented in the\nreadme.txt file included with the patch files. The following security\nissues are addressed in this release:\n\nIt was found that Apache Camel's XML converter performed XML External\nEntity (XXE) expansion. A remote attacker able to submit an SAXSource\ncontaining an XXE declaration could use this flaw to read files accessible\nto the user running the application server, and potentially perform other\nmore advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0263)\n\nIt was found that Apache Camel performed XML External Entity (XXE)\nexpansion when evaluating invalid XML Strings or invalid XML GenericFile\nobjects. A remote attacker able to submit a crafted XML message could use\nthis flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application\nserver, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.\n(CVE-2015-0264)\n\nRefer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for\ninstallation instructions.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.",
