				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,\nflexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.\nRed Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant\nmessaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.\n\nThis patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ\n6.1.0. It includes a bug fix, which is documented in the readme.txt file\nincluded with the patch files. The following security issues are addressed\nin this release:\n\nIt was found that if a configured LDAP server supported the unauthenticated\nauthentication mechanism (as described by RFC 4513), the LDAPLoginModule\nimplementation, provided by ActiveMQ Java Authentication and Authorization\nService (JAAS), would consider an authentication attempt to be successful\nfor a valid user that provided an empty password. A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to bypass the authentication mechanism of an application\nusing LDAPLoginModule, and assume a role of any valid user within\nthat application. (CVE-2014-3612)\n\nIt was discovered that Apache ActiveMQ performed XML External Entity (XXE)\nexpansion when evaluating XPath expressions. A remote, attacker-controlled\nconsumer able to specify an XPath-based selector to dequeue XML messages\nfrom an Apache ActiveMQ broker could use this flaw to read files accessible\nto the user running the broker, and potentially perform other more advanced\nXXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3600)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Georgi Geshev of MWR Labs for reporting these\nissues.\n\nRefer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for\ninstallation instructions.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this\nsecurity update.",
