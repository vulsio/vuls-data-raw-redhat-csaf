Refer to the 2.7.0 Release\nNotes for information on the most significant of these changes, available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/\n\nThis release also fixes the following security issues:\n\nIt was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted host name from\nan X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field. A man-in-the-middle\nattacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially\ncrafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)\n\nNote: For additional information on these two flaws, refer to the\nKnowledgebase article in the References section.\n\nIt was found that external parameter entities were not disabled when the\nresteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false.\nA remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could\nuse this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application\nserver, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.\n(CVE-2014-3490)\n\nIt was discovered that the implementation of\norg.hibernate.validator.util.ReflectionHelper together with the permissions\nrequired to run Hibernate Validator under the Java Security Manager could\nallow a malicious application deployed in the same application container to\nexecute several actions with escalated privileges, which might otherwise\nnot be possible. This flaw could be used to perform various attacks,\nincluding but not restricted to, arbitrary code execution in systems that\nare otherwise secured by the Java Security Manager. (CVE-2014-3558)\n\nThe CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product\nSecurity, and the CVE-2014-3490 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red\nHat Product Security.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.6.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Framework\nKit 2.7.0.",
