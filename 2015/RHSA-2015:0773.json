				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on\nInfinispan.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.1 serves as a replacement for\nRed Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.0. It includes various bug fixes and\nenhancements, which are detailed in the Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.1\nRelease Notes. The Release Notes are available at:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Data_Grid/\n\nThis update also fixes the following security issues:\n\nIt was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for\nBleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an\nexception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the\nattempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack.\nThe original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain\ntext form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)\n\nA resource consumption issue was found in the way Xerces-J handled XML\ndeclarations. A remote attacker could use an XML document with a specially\ncrafted declaration using a long pseudo-attribute name that, when parsed by\nan application using Xerces-J, would cause that application to use an\nexcessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2013-4002)\n\nIt was found that the RESTEasy DocumentProvider did not set the\nexternal-parameter-entities and external-general-entities features\nappropriately, thus allowing external entity expansion. A remote attacker\nable to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could use this flaw to\nread files accessible to the user running the application server, and\npotentially perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks.\n(CVE-2014-7839)\n\nIt was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the\nrequireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature\nwrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the\ncontents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)\n\nIt was discovered that under specific conditions the conversation state\ninformation stored in a thread-local variable in JBoss Weld was not\nsanitized correctly when the conversation ended. This could lead to a race\ncondition that could potentially expose sensitive information from a\nprevious conversation to the current conversation. (CVE-2014-8122)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Rune Steinseth of JProfessionals for reporting\nthe CVE-2014-8122 issue.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.1.",
