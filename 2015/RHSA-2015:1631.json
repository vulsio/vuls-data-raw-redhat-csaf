(CVE-2015-3010, CVE-2015-4053)\n\nceph has been upgraded from v0.80.8.1 to v0.80.8.2. This upgrade fixes the\nfollowing bugs:\n\n* .rgw pool contains extra objects (BZ#1212524)\n* rgw bucket/object owner override when setting acls (BZ#1214051)\n* librbd: aio calls may block (BZ#1225172)\n\nice_setup has been upgraded from v0.3.0-2 to v0.3.2. This upgrade fixes a\nbug where ice_setup would crash if the \"setuptools\" Python package was not\nalready installed on the Calamari admin node. (rhbz #1212045)\n\nAll ceph-deploy users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncorrects these issues.",
