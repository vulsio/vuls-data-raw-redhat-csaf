This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future\nupdate; it is recommended that users configure their applications to\nrequire at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.\n\nFor additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article\nat https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
