				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that\nprovides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources\nto multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data\nspread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML\nfiles, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local\ndatabase.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data\nVirtualization 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in\nthe README file included with the patch files.\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that Odata4j permitted XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. If a\nREST endpoint was deployed, a remote attacker could submit a request\ncontaining an external XML entity that, when resolved, allowed that\nattacker to read files on the application server in the context of the user\nrunning that server. (CVE-2014-0171)\n\nThe HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name\nin /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom\nlibrary path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native\nlibraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI\nwrites them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)\n\nIt was found that the security audit functionality logged request\nparameters in plain text. This may have caused passwords to be included in\nthe audit log files when using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local\nattacker with access to audit log files could possibly use this flaw to\nobtain application or server authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0171 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product\nSecurity; the CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red\nHat Product Security.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.",
