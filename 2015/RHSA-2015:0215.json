A remote attacker\nable to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could use this flaw to\nread files accessible to the user running the application server, and\npotentially perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks.\n(CVE-2014-7839)\n\nIt was discovered that the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation\ndid not sufficiently verify all authorization conditions that are required\nby the Maintainer role to perform certain administrative actions.\nAn authenticated user with the Maintainer role could use this flaw to add,\nmodify, or undefine a limited set of attributes and their values, which\notherwise cannot be written to. (CVE-2014-7849)\n\nIt was discovered that the JBoss Application Server (WildFly) JacORB\nsubsystem incorrectly assigned socket-binding-ref sensitivity\nclassification for the security-domain attribute. An authenticated user\nwith a role that has access to attributes with socket-binding-ref and not\nsecurity-domain-ref sensitivity classification could use this flaw to\naccess sensitive information present in the security-domain attribute.\n(CVE-2014-7853)\n\nIt was found that when processing undefined security domains, the\norg.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager implementation would\nfall back to the default security domain if it was available. A user with\nvalid credentials in the defined default domain, with a role that is valid\nin the expected application domain, could perform actions that were\notherwise not available to them. When using the SAML2 STS Login Module,\nJBossMappingManager exposed this issue due to the PicketLink Trust\nSecurityActions implementation using a hardcoded default value when\ndefining the context. (CVE-2014-7827)\n\nIt was discovered that under specific conditions the conversation state\ninformation stored in a thread-local variable was not sanitized correctly\nwhen the conversation ended. This could lead to a race condition that could\npotentially expose sensitive information from a previous conversation to\nthe current conversation. (CVE-2014-8122)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Rune Steinseth of JProfessionals for reporting\nthe CVE-2014-8122 issue. The CVE-2014-7849 and CVE-2014-7853 issues were\ndiscovered by Darran Lofthouse of the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform Team, and the CVE-2014-7827 issue was discovered by Ondra Lukas of\nthe Red Hat Quality Engineering Team.\n\nThis release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 6.3.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.\nDocumentation for these changes is available from the link in the\nReferences section.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
