				"text": "Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process\nautomation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage\nexisting (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and\nCEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process\nexecution speed and quality.\n\nIt was found that the code which checked that the server hostname matches\nthe domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates\nwas flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an\nSSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153,\nCVE-2014-3577)\n\nIt was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML\ncontent, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass\nXML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,\nincluding remote code execution in the context of the server running the\nXStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)\n\nIt was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had\ninsufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.\nA remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language\nTransformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using\nXalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the\nsecure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the\nclasspath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the\ncontext of the application server running the application that uses\nXalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)\n\nIt was found that the org.jboss.seam.web.AuthenticationFilter class\nimplementation did not properly use Seam logging. A remote attacker could\nsend specially crafted authentication headers to an application, which\ncould result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user\nrunning that application. (CVE-2014-0248)\n\nIt was found that the implementation of the\norg.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method\nprovided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files\naccessible to the user running the application server, and potentially\nperform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)\n\nIt was discovered that the implementation used by the Not Yet Commons SSL\nproject to check that the server host name matches the domain name in the\nsubject's CN field was flawed. This could be exploited by a\nman-in-the-middle attacker by spoofing a valid certificate using a\nspecially crafted subject. (CVE-2014-3604)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Alexander Papadakis for reporting\nCVE-2014-3530. The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of\nRed Hat Product Security, the CVE-2014-3604 issue was discovered by Arun\nBabu Neelicattu of Red Hat Product Security, and the CVE-2014-0248 issue\nwas discovered by Marek Schmidt of Red Hat.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this security update.",
