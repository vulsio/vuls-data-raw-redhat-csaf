Refer to\nthe Release Notes document, available from the link in the References\nsection, for a list of changes.\n\nThe following security issues are resolved with this update:\n\nIt was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)\n\nIt was found that JBoss Fuse would allow any user defined in the users.properties file to access the HawtIO console without having a valid admin role. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass intended authentication HawtIO console access restrictions. (CVE-2014-8175)\n\nIt was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)\n\nIt was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)\n\nIt was found that PKIX trust components allowed an X509 credential to be trusted if no trusted names were available for the entityID. An attacker could use a certificate issued by a shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchor to impersonate an entity within the scope of that keyAuthority. (CVE-2015-1796)\n\nThe CVE-2014-8175 issue was reported by Jay Kumar SenSharma of Red Hat.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to apply this update.",
