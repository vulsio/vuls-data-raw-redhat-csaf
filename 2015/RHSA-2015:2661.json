It is comprised of the\nApache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache\nTomcat Connector (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster),\nHibernate, and the Tomcat Native library.\n\nIt was found that Tomcat would keep connections open after processing\nrequests with a large enough request body. A remote attacker could\npotentially use this flaw to exhaust the pool of available connections\nand prevent further, legitimate connections to the Tomcat server.\n(CVE-2014-0230)\n\nA flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when\nprocessing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could\nuse Trailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header\nprocessing was performed by other modules. This could, for example,\nlead to a bypass of header restrictions defined with mod_headers.\n(CVE-2013-5704)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and\nresponses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could\nuse these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd\nwould decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it,\npossibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)\n\n* This enhancement update adds the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.2\npackages to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. These packages provide a\nnumber of enhancements over the previous version of Red Hat JBoss Web\nServer.
