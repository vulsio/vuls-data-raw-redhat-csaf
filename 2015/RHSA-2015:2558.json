It includes various\nbug fixes, which are listed in the README file included with the patch\nfiles.\n\nThe following security issues are fixed with this release:\n\nA flaw was discovered that when an application uses Groovy (has it on the\nclasspath) and uses the standard Java serialization mechanism, an attacker\ncan bake a special serialized object that executes code directly when\ndeserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not\nisolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this\nvulnerability. (CVE-2015-3253)\n\nIt was found that Apache Camel's XML converter performed XML External\nEntity (XXE) expansion. A remote attacker able to submit an SAXSource\ncontaining an XXE declaration could use this flaw to read files accessible\nto the user running the application server, and potentially perform other\nmore advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0263)\n\nIt was found that Apache Camel performed XML External Entity (XXE)\nexpansion when evaluating invalid XML Strings or invalid XML GenericFile\nobjects. A remote attacker able to submit a crafted XML message could use\nthis flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application\nserver, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.\n(CVE-2015-0264)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.",
