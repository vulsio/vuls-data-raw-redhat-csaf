Refer to the\nRed Hat JBoss BRMS 6.2.0 Release Notes for information on the most\nsignificant of these changes. The Release Notes are available at\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-brms/\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code\nexecution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed\nchain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute\narbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the\ncommons-collections library. (CVE-2015-7501)\n\nFurther information about this security flaw may be found at:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/2045023\n\nIt was found that batik was vulnerable to XML External Entity attacks when\nparsing SVG files. A remote attacker able to send malicious SVG content to\nthe affected server could use this flaw to read files accessible to the\nuser running the application server, and potentially perform other more\nadvanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0250)\n\nIt was found that jsoup did not properly validate user-supplied HTML\ncontent; certain HTML snippets could get past the validator without being\ndetected as unsafe. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted HTML\nsnippet to execute arbitrary web script in the user's browser.\n(CVE-2015-6748)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.2 as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.2.0.",
