				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,\nflexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.\n\nRed Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 is a micro product release that updates Red Hat\nJBoss Fuse 6.2.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to\nthe Release Notes document, available from the link in the References\nsection, for a list of changes.\n\nThe following security fixes are addressed in this release:\n\nIt was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code\nexecution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed\nchain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute\narbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the\ncommons-collections library. (CVE-2015-7501)\n\nFurther information about this issue may be found at:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/2045023\n\nA flaw was discovered that when an application uses Groovy (has it on the\nclasspath) and uses the standard Java serialization mechanism, an attacker\ncan bake a special serialized object that executes code directly when\ndeserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not\nisolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this\nvulnerability. (CVE-2015-3253)\n\nIt was found that the JBoss A-MQ console would accept a string containing\nJavaScript as the name of a new message queue. Execution of the UI would\nsubsequently execute the script. An attacker could use this flaw to access\nsensitive information or perform other attacks. (CVE-2015-5181)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Naftali Rosenbaum of Comsec Consulting for\nreporting CVE-2015-5181.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 are advised to apply this update.",
