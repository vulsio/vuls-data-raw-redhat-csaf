It is comprised of the Apache\nHTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector\n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat\nNative library.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the mod_cluster manager processed certain MCMP\nmessages. An attacker with access to the network from which MCMP messages\nare allowed to be sent could use this flaw to execute arbitrary JavaScript\ncode in the mod_cluster manager web interface. (CVE-2015-0298)\n\nIt was discovered that a JkUnmount rule for a subtree of a previous JkMount\nrule could be ignored. This could allow a remote attacker to potentially\naccess a private artifact in a tree that would otherwise not be accessible\nto them. (CVE-2014-8111)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web\nServer process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
