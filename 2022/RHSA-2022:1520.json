During processing of the parameters OpenSSL will call BN_mod_sqrt() with invalid arguments, causing the process to enter an infinite loop. The invalid EC parameters can be provided to OpenSSL through X.509 certificates (used in TLS connections), through public and private keys, through certificate signing requests and other places where applications process Elliptic Curve parameters.
