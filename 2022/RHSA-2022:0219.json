					"text": "Red Hat Product Security has performed an analysis of this flaw and has classified the Attack Complexity(AC) as High because there are multiple factors involved which are beyond attacker's control:\n\n- The application has to use the logging configuration using a Context Map Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) which is a non-default Pattern Layout.\n- The application developer has to use the map org.apache.logging.log4j.ThreadContext in the application code and save at-least one key (for example, ThreadContext.put(\"loginId\", \"myId\");) in the ThreadContext map object.\n- Attackers must also know this saved key name in order to exploit this flaw.\n\nNote that saving keys in this map is a non-essential usage of log4j and just an optional feature provided. Refer to https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html#ContextMapLookup to know more about the Context Map Lookup feature of Log4j.\n\nLog4j 1.x is not impacted by this vulnerability. Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using ONLY the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are NOT impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n\nDespite including a vulnerable version of Log4j 2.x, this vulnerability is not exploitable in Elasticsearch[0], as shipped in OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Logging. OpenShift 3.11 specifically does not contain any context lookups:\n\nhttps://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/release-3.11/roles/openshift_logging_elasticsearch/templates/log4j2.properties.j2\n\nThis vulnerability is therefore rated Low for Elasticsearch in OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Logging.\n\n[0] https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476#update-december-18-4",
