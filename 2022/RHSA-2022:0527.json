However, the attack vector is reduced as it depends on having write access, which is not a standard configuration rather than untrusted user input. These are sufficient factors beyond the attacker's control.\n\nThe tomcat package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux does not include log4j but it does include a default configuration for log4j, log4j.properties, which could be used with tomcat if users choose to install and configure the library. The JMSAppender is not enabled by default, and the permissions of the file can only be modified as root.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization ships log4j12-1.2.17, but it is used and configured in a way which makes this flaw not possible to exploit.
