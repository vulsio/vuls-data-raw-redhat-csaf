The optional Java system property, hsqldb.method_class_names, allows preventing access to classes other than java.lang.Math or specifying a semicolon-separated list of allowed classes. A property value that ends with .* is treated as a wild card and allows access to all class or method names formed by substitution of the * (asterisk).\n\nIn the example below, the property has been included as an argument to the Java command.\n\n java -Dhsqldb.method_class_names=\"org.me.MyClass;org.you.YourClass;org.you.lib.*\" [the rest of the command line]\n\nThe above example allows access to the methods in the two classes: org.me.MyClass and org.you.YourClass together with all the classes in the org.you.lib package. Note that if the property is not defined, no access control is performed at this level.\n\nThe user who creates a Java routine must have the relevant access privileges on the tables that are used inside the Java method.\n\nOnce the routine has been defined, the normal database access control applies to its user. The routine can be executed only by those users who have been granted EXECUTE privileges on it. Access to routines can be granted to users with GRANT EXECUTE or GRANT ALL. For example, GRANT EXECUTE ON myroutine TO PUBLIC.\n\nIn hsqldb 2.7.1, all classes by default are not accessible, except those in java.lang.Math and need to be manually enabled.",

					"text": "In order to carry successful exploitation of this vulnerability, the following conditions must be in place on the affected target:\n  - Usage of specific methods that interpolate the variables as described in the flaw\n  - Usage of external input for those methods\n  - Usage of that external input has to be unsanitized/no \"allow list\"/etc.\n\nThe following products have *Low* impact because they have maven references to the affected package but do not ship it nor use the code:\n- Red Hat EAP Expansion Pack (EAP-XP)\n- Red Hat Camel-K\n- Red Hat Camel-Quarkus\n\nRed Hat Satellite ships Candlepin that embeds Apache Commons Text, however, it is not vulnerable to the flaw since the library has not been exposed in the product code. In Candlepin, the Commons Text is being pulled for the Liquibase and ActiveMQ Artemis libraries as a dependency. Red Hat Product Security has evaluated and rated the impact of the flaw as Low for Satellite since there was no harm identified to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems.\n\n- The OCP has a *Moderate* impact because the affected library is a third-party library in the OCP jenkins-2-plugin component which reduces the possibilities of successful exploitation.\n- The OCP-4.8 is affected by this CVE and is in an extended life phase. For versions of products in the Extended Life Phase, Red Hat will provide limited ongoing technical support. No bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis will be available during this phase, and support will be provided on existing installations only.",
