In Candlepin, the Commons Text is being pulled for the Liquibase and ActiveMQ Artemis libraries as a dependency. Red Hat Product Security has evaluated and rated the impact of the flaw as Low for Satellite since there was no harm identified to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems.\n\n- The OCP has a *Moderate* impact because the affected library is a third-party library in the OCP jenkins-2-plugin component which reduces the possibilities of successful exploitation.\n- The OCP-4.8 is affected by this CVE and is in an extended life phase. For versions of products in the Extended Life Phase, Red Hat will provide limited ongoing technical support. No bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis will be available during this phase, and support will be provided on existing installations only.",
