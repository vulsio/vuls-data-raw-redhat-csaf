Because Elasticsearch is not susceptible to remote code execution with this vulnerability due to use of the Java Security Manager and because access to these components is limited, the impact by this vulnerability is reduced to Moderate.\n\nAs per upstream applications using Log4j 1.x may be impacted by this flaw if their configuration uses JNDI. However, the risk is much lower. This flaw in Log4j 1.x is tracked via https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4104 and has been rated as having Moderate security impact.\n\nCodeReady Studio version 12.21.1 was released containing a fix for this vulnerability.\n\nThe following products are NOT affected by this flaw and have been explicitly listed here for the benefit of our customers.\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes \n- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes\n- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (Engine and Tower)\n- Red Hat Certificate System\n- Red Hat Directory Server\n- Red Hat Identity Management\n- Red Hat CloudForms \n- Red Hat Update Infrastructure\n- Red Hat Satellite\n- Red Hat Ceph Storage\n- Red Hat Gluster Storage\n- Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation\n- Red Hat OpenStack Platform\n- Red Hat Virtualization\n- Red Hat Single Sign-On\n- Red Hat 3scale API Management",

This is not the default configuration for end-applications using log4j 2.x and would require explicit action from a privileged user (a developer or administrator) to access the vulnerability. \nIn certain non-default configurations, it was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was insufficient.\n\nThis issue affects the log4j version between 2.0 and 2.15. Log4j 1.x is NOT impacted by this vulnerability. \n\nPrerequisites to exploit this flaw are :\n\n- A remotely accessible endpoint with any protocol (HTTP, TCP, etc) that allows an attacker to send arbitrary data,\n- A log statement in the endpoint that logs the attacker controlled data.\n- Log4j configuration file should be explicitly configured to use a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup eg. ($${ctx:loginId}) \n\nIn most cases, the mitigation suggested for CVE-2021-44228 (i.e. to set the system property `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` to `true) does NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability. \nLog4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.\n\nFor Elasticsearch, as shipped in OpenShift 3.11, the \"log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true\" system property mitigation is sufficient as there are no included non-standard configurations that allow for exploitation:\n\nhttps://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/release-3.11/roles/openshift_logging_elasticsearch/templates/log4j2.properties.j2\n\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476\n\nFor CodeReady Studio the fix for this flaw is available on CodeReady Studio 12.21.3 and above versions.",

					"text": "Red Hat Product Security has performed an analysis of this flaw and has classified the Attack Complexity(AC) as High because there are multiple factors involved which are beyond attacker's control:\n\n- The application has to use the logging configuration using a Context Map Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) which is a non-default Pattern Layout.\n- The application developer has to use the map org.apache.logging.log4j.ThreadContext in the application code and save at-least one key (for example, ThreadContext.put(\"loginId\", \"myId\");) in the ThreadContext map object.\n- Attackers must also know this saved key name in order to exploit this flaw.\n\nNote that saving keys in this map is a non-essential usage of log4j and just an optional feature provided. Refer to https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html#ContextMapLookup to know more about the Context Map Lookup feature of Log4j.\n\nLog4j 1.x is not impacted by this vulnerability. Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using ONLY the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are NOT impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n\nDespite including a vulnerable version of Log4j 2.x, this vulnerability is not exploitable in Elasticsearch[0], as shipped in OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Logging. OpenShift 3.11 specifically does not contain any context lookups:\n\nhttps://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/release-3.11/roles/openshift_logging_elasticsearch/templates/log4j2.properties.j2\n\nThis vulnerability is therefore rated Low for Elasticsearch in OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Logging.\n\n[0] https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476#update-december-18-4",
