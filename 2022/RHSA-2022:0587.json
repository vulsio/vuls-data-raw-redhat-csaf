STF then transmits the information to a centralized, receiving Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) deployment for storage, retrieval, and monitoring.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* golang: net/http: limit growth of header canonicalization cache (CVE-2021-44716) \n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* In some cases, Ceilometer metrics were not handled properly by sg-core. This resulted in some Ceilometer metrics not being stored in Prometheus. In this release, the processing of metrics has been enhanced to be more robust. While the sg-core has been enhanced to support larger messages from Ceilometer, an additional change is required to support passing the larger messages through the sg-bridge ring buffer. The changes required to fully support this functionality are being tracked in RHBZ#2053683. (BZ#2016460)",
