This flaw has been filed for Log4j 1.x, and the corresponding flaw information for Log4j 2.x is available at: https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-44228\n\nNote this flaw ONLY affects applications which are specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default, or when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration for adding JMSAppender to the attacker's JNDI LDAP endpoint. \n\nIf the Log4j configuration is set TopicBindingName or TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations allowing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228 Log4j 2.x, Log4j 1.x is vulnerable. However, the attack vector is reduced as it depends on having write access, which is not a standard configuration rather than untrusted user input. These are sufficient factors beyond the attacker's control.\n\nThe tomcat package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux does not include log4j but it does include a default configuration for log4j, log4j.properties, which could be used with tomcat if users choose to install and configure the library. The JMSAppender is not enabled by default, and the permissions of the file can only be modified as root.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization ships log4j12-1.2.17, but it is used and configured in a way which makes this flaw not possible to exploit. Therefore impact is rated Low.",

This is not the default configuration for end-applications using log4j 2.x and would require explicit action from a privileged user (a developer or administrator) to access the vulnerability. \nIn certain non-default configurations, it was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was insufficient.\n\nThis issue affects the log4j version between 2.0 and 2.15. Log4j 1.x is NOT impacted by this vulnerability. \n\nPrerequisites to exploit this flaw are :\n\n- A remotely accessible endpoint with any protocol (HTTP, TCP, etc) that allows an attacker to send arbitrary data,\n- A log statement in the endpoint that logs the attacker controlled data.\n- Log4j configuration file should be explicitly configured to use a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup eg. ($${ctx:loginId}) \n\nIn most cases, the mitigation suggested for CVE-2021-44228 (i.e. to set the system property `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` to `true) does NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability. \nLog4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.\n\nFor Elasticsearch, as shipped in OpenShift 3.11, the \"log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true\" system property mitigation is sufficient as there are no included non-standard configurations that allow for exploitation:\n\nhttps://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/release-3.11/roles/openshift_logging_elasticsearch/templates/log4j2.properties.j2\n\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476\n\nFor CodeReady Studio the fix for this flaw is available on CodeReady Studio 12.21.3 and above versions.",

					"text": "Chainsaw is a standalone graphical user interface for viewing log entries in log4j. This flaw may be bypassed by using other available means to access log entries.\n\nRed Hat Satellite bundles log4j-over-slf4j with Candlepin, however, product is not affected as it uses logback framework for logging.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization ships a vulnerable version of the log4j package, however chainsaw is not part of typical use cases. An attacker looking to exploit this would need to not only be able to generate a malicious log entry, but also have the necessary access and permissions to start chainsaw on the engine node. Therefore the impact of this vulnerability for Red Hat Virtualization is rated Low.\n\nSimilar to Red Hat Virtualization in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of log4j package, however vulnerable chainsaw component is not used by default. Therefore the impact to OCP is reduced to Low.",
