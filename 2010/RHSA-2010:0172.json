				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\n(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated\nKernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything\nnecessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64\narchitectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function in the Linux kernel Stream\nControl Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker\ncould send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in\na denial of service. (CVE-2010-0008)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the x86 emulator in KVM loaded segment\nselectors (used for memory segmentation and protection) into segment\nregisters. In some guest system configurations, an unprivileged guest user\ncould leverage this flaw to crash the guest or possibly escalate their\nprivileges within the guest. (CVE-2010-0419)\n\nThe KVM x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current\nPrivilege Level (CPL) while accessing debug registers. An unprivileged user\nin a guest could leverage this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2009-3722)\n\nA flaw was found in the USB passthrough handling code in KVM. A\nspecially-crafted USB packet sent from inside a guest could be used to\ntrigger a buffer overflow in the usb_host_handle_control() function, which\nruns under the QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could\nleverage this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest hang or crash) or\npossibly escalate their privileges within the host. (CVE-2010-0297)\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nsecurity issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV\nHypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2009-4308, CVE-2010-0003,\nCVE-2010-0007, CVE-2010-0415, and CVE-2010-0437; and sudo issues\nCVE-2010-0426 and CVE-2010-0427.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the required storage device driver was not detected correctly by mkdumprd\nwhen using multipath devices. When RHEV Hypervisor was installed on a\nmultipath device, kdump was unable to mount the logical volume to store the\nkernel core dump; therefore, the core dump would not be recorded. With this\nupdate, multipath support has been added to the mkdumprd tool, which\nresolves this issue. (BZ#569459)\n\nAs RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from KVM updates\nRHSA-2010:0126 and RHBA-2010:0158 have been included in this update:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0126.html\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0158.html\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.",
