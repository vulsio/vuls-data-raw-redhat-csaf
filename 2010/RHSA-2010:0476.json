				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the\nLinux virtio-net driver, used by guest operating systems. Due to a\ndeficiency in the TSO (TCP segment offloading) implementation, a guest's\nvirtio-net driver would transmit improper data to a certain QEMU-KVM\nprocess on the host, causing the guest to crash. A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to send specially-crafted data to a target guest system,\ncausing that guest to crash. (CVE-2010-0741)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)\nhandled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an\nimage or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely\ndeleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a\nnew, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it,\ncould use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs,\npotentially disclosing sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2223)\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nsecurity issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for dbus issue\nCVE-2009-1189; kernel issues CVE-2010-0307, CVE-2010-0410, CVE-2010-0730,\nCVE-2010-1085, and CVE-2010-1086; openldap issue CVE-2009-3767; and sudo\nissues CVE-2010-0426, CVE-2010-0427, and CVE-2010-1163.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs and adds several enhancements.\nDocumentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available from\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/2.2/html/Servers-5.5-2.2_Hypervisor_Security_Update\n\nAs Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug\nfixes and enhancements from the KVM updates RHSA-2010:0271 and\nRHBA-2010:0419 have been included in this update. Also included are the bug\nfixes and enhancements from the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)\nupdate RHSA-2010:0473, and fence-agents update RHBA-2010:0477.\n\nKVM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0271.html and\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0419.html\nVDSM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0473.html\nfence-agents: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0477.html\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues and adds these\nenhancements.",
