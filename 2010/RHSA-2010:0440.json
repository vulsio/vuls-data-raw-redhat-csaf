				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\n(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated\nKernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything\nnecessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64\narchitectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL did not always check the return value of\nthe bn_wexpand() function. An attacker able to trigger a memory allocation\nfailure in that function could cause an application using the OpenSSL\nlibrary to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-3245)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure\nSockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle\nattacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's\nsession (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force\nthe server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the\nvictim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw in openssl, nss, and\ngnutls by implementing the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as\ndefined in RFC 5746. (CVE-2009-3555)\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nsecurity issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV\nHypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2009-4307, CVE-2010-0727,\nCVE-2009-4027, and CVE-2010-1188; cpio issues CVE-2010-0624 and\nCVE-2007-4476; gnutls issue CVE-2009-2409; openssl issue CVE-2010-0433; and\ntar issues CVE-2010-0624 and CVE-2007-4476.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* bridged network interfaces using the bnx2x, mlx4_en, enic and s2io\ndrivers had Large Receive Offload (LRO) enabled by default. This caused\nsignificantly degraded network I/O performance. LRO has been disabled for\nall network interface drivers which have LRO enabled by default in Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5. With this change, network I/O performance is\nsignificantly improved. (BZ#576374, BZ#579730)\n\n* RHEV Hypervisor supported IPv6, but as this is not used to communicate\nwith the RHEV Manager, it is superfluous. Support for IPv6 has now been\ndisabled in RHEV Hypervisor. (BZ#577300)\n\n* for VLAN interfaces, the hardware (MAC) address of the interface was set\nonly in the VLAN ifcfg script, not in the physical interface ifcfg script.\nThis caused network interfaces with VLAN tags to intermittently fail on\nboot. The MAC address is now set in the ifcfg script for the underlying\nphysical interface. Network interfaces with VLAN tags now work consistently\nbetween reboots. (BZ#581876)\n\n* the hypervisor would hang on reboot after repeated upgrade operations,\ndue to GRUB accessing the /boot file system before it was flushed. The\n/boot file system is now remounted before GRUB accesses it. (BZ#591111)\n\nAs RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update\nRHBA-2010:0434 have been included in this update. Also included are the bug\nfixes from the RHEV Manager Agent (VDSM) update RHBA-2010:0435.\n\nKVM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0434.html\nVDSM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0435.html\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.",
