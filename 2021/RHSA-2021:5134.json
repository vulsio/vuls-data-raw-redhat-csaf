The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced advisories.",

					"text": "XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in the deletion of a file on the local host. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.",

Instead of sending a JWT token as a \"request\" parameter, the spec also supports specifying a URI from which to retrieve a JWT token from via the \"request_uri\" parameter. CXF was not validating the \"request_uri\" parameter (apart from ensuring it uses \"https) and was making a REST request to the parameter in the request to retrieve a token. This means that CXF was vulnerable to DDos attacks on the authorization server, as specified in section 10.4.1 of the spec. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.3; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.10.",

In order to exploit this flaw you need:\n- A remotely accessible endpoint with any protocol (HTTP, TCP, etc) that allows an attacker to send arbitrary data,\n- A log statement in the endpoint that logs the attacker controlled data.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenShift Logging the vulnerable log4j library is shipped in the Elasticsearch components. Because Elasticsearch is not susceptible to remote code execution with this vulnerability due to use of the Java Security Manager and because access to these components is limited, the impact by this vulnerability is reduced to Moderate.\n\nAs per upstream applications using Log4j 1.x may be impacted by this flaw if their configuration uses JNDI. However, the risk is much lower. This flaw in Log4j 1.x is tracked via https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4104 and has been rated as having Moderate security impact.\n\nCodeReady Studio version 12.21.1 was released containing a fix for this vulnerability.\n\nThe following products are NOT affected by this flaw and have been explicitly listed here for the benefit of our customers.\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes \n- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes\n- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (Engine and Tower)\n- Red Hat Certificate System\n- Red Hat Directory Server\n- Red Hat Identity Management\n- Red Hat CloudForms \n- Red Hat Update Infrastructure\n- Red Hat Satellite\n- Red Hat Ceph Storage\n- Red Hat Gluster Storage\n- Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation\n- Red Hat OpenStack Platform\n- Red Hat Virtualization\n- Red Hat Single Sign-On\n- Red Hat 3scale API Management",
