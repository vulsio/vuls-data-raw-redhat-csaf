Red Hat does not ship any applications compiled with openssl, which used the above function in a vulnerable way.\n\n2. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes, when comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate and when verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token). If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example, if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then a crash may be triggered.\n\nThird party applications compiled with openssl using the function GENERAL_NAME_cmp in a vulnerable way are affected by this flaw.\n\nGENERAL_NAME_cmp was added in 0.9.8k, therefore older versions of openssl are not affected by this flaw.",
