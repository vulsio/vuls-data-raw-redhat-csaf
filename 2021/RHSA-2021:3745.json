The attacker should also perform some kind of target-specific reconnaissance in order to find out all the above information.\n\nThe version of httpd as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is affected by this flaw even if the upstream code was not, because the Unix Domain Socket support required to trigger the flaw was backported.\nThe version of httpd as shipped in Red hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected by this flaw because there is no support for Unix Domain Socket.\n\nThe flaw can be triggered only if mod_proxy is in use (e.g. ProxyPass, ReverseProxy is used in the httpd configuration files).",
