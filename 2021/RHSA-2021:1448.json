Additionally this library is used in openshift4/ose-grafana container only in Grafana End-to-End Test package. Therefore the impact by this flaw is reduced to Low and the affected OCP components are marked as \"will not fix\" at this time and to Moderate for the affected RHACM components. This might be fixed in a future release.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization includes the vulnerable underscore library, however it is not parsing any untrusted data, therefore impact is reduced to Low.\n\nBelow Red Hat products include the underscore dependency, but it is not used by the product and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.\n\n* Red Hat Quay\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage 3\n* Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4\n* Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4",
