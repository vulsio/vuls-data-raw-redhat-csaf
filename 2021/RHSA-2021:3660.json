Additionally the hive container only references velocity in the testutils of the code but the code still exists in the container, as such it has been given a Moderate impact.\n\n* Velocity as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected because it does not contain the vulnerable code.\n\n* Velocity as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 contains a vulnerable version, but it is used as a dependency for IdM/ipa, which does not use the vulnerable functionality.
