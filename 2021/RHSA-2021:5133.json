					"text": "This issue only affects log4j versions between 2.0  and 2.14.1. In order to exploit this flaw you need:\n- A remotely accessible endpoint with any protocol (HTTP, TCP, etc) that allows an attacker to send arbitrary data,\n- A log statement in the endpoint that logs the attacker controlled data.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenShift Logging the vulnerable log4j library is shipped in the Elasticsearch components. Because Elasticsearch is not susceptible to remote code execution with this vulnerability due to use of the Java Security Manager and because access to these components is limited, the impact by this vulnerability is reduced to Moderate.\n\nAs per upstream applications using Log4j 1.x may be impacted by this flaw if their configuration uses JNDI. However, the risk is much lower. This flaw in Log4j 1.x is tracked via https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4104 and has been rated as having Moderate security impact.\n\nCodeReady Studio version 12.21.1 was released containing a fix for this vulnerability.\n\nThe following products are NOT affected by this flaw and have been explicitly listed here for the benefit of our customers.\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes \n- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes\n- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (Engine and Tower)\n- Red Hat Certificate System\n- Red Hat Directory Server\n- Red Hat Identity Management\n- Red Hat CloudForms \n- Red Hat Update Infrastructure\n- Red Hat Satellite\n- Red Hat Ceph Storage\n- Red Hat Gluster Storage\n- Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation\n- Red Hat OpenStack Platform\n- Red Hat Virtualization\n- Red Hat Single Sign-On\n- Red Hat 3scale API Management",
