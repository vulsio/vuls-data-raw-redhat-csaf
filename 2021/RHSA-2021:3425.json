However, in these specific contexts, the prerequisites to the vulnerability are not met. The PersistentManager is not set, and a SecurityManager is used. The use of `pki-servlet-engine` outside of these contexts is not supported. As a result, the vulnerability can not be triggered in supported configurations of these products.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight will not be updated for this flaw because it was deprecated as of OpenStack Platform 14 and is only receiving security fixes for Important and Critical flaws.",
