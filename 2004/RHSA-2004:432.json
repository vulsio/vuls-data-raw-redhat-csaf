This issue poses the threat of remote execution, since\nAcrobat Reader may be the default handler for PDF files.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-0631\nto this issue.\n\niDEFENSE also reported that Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 contains an input\nvalidation error in its uuencoding feature.  An attacker could create a\nfile with a specially crafted file name which could lead to arbitrary\ncommand execution on a victim's machine.
