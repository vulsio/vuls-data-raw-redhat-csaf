An attacker could execute\narbitrary code on a victim's machine if a user opens a specially crafted\nuuencoded document.  This issue poses the threat of remote execution, since\nAcrobat Reader may be the default handler for PDF files.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-0631\nto this issue.\n\niDEFENSE also reported that Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 contains an input\nvalidation error in its uuencoding feature.  An attacker could create a\nfile with a specially crafted file name which could lead to arbitrary\ncommand execution on a victim's machine.
