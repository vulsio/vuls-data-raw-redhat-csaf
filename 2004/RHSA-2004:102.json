				"text": "The gdk-pixbuf package contains an image loading library used with the \nGNOME GUI desktop environment.  In Red Hat Linux 9 this library is used by\napplications, such as Evolution, to load images.\n\nThomas Kristensen discovered a bitmap file that would cause the Evolution\nmail reader to crash.  This issue was caused by a flaw that affects\nversions of the gdk-pixbuf package prior to 0.20.  To exploit this flaw, a\nremote attacker could send (via email) a carefully-crafted BMP file, which\nwould cause Evolution to crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0111\nto this issue.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated packages containing\ngdk-pixbuf version 0.22, which is not vulnerable to this issue.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt",
