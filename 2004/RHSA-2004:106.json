The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0109 to this issue.\n\nA flaw in return value checking in mremap() in the Linux kernel versions\n2.4.24 and previous that may allow a local attacker to gain root\nprivileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0077 to this issue.\n\nA flaw in ncp_lookup() in ncpfs could allow local privilege escalation.\nThe ncpfs module allows a system to mount volumes of NetWare servers or\nprint to NetWare printers. This is part of the kernel-unsupported package.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0010 to this issue.\n\nA flaw in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure could allow local privilege\nescalation. This driver is part of the kernel-unsupported package. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0003 to this issue.\n\nAn overflow was found in the ixj telephony card driver in Linux kernels\nprior to 2.4.20.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1574 to this issue.\n\nThe following drivers were updated:\n\nIBM Serveraid 6.11.07\nMPT fusion v. 2.05.11.03\nQlogic v. 6.07.02-RH1\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain\nbackported security patches that correct these issues.",
