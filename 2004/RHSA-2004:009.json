The frm command is provided as\npart of the Elm packages and gives a summary list of the sender and subject\nof selected messages in a mailbox or folder.\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the frm command.  An attacker\ncould create a message with an overly long Subject line such that when the\nfrm command is run by a victim arbitrary code is executed.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0966 to this issue.\n\nUsers of the frm command should update to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported security patch that corrects this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Paul Rubin for discovering and disclosing this\nissue.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt",
