				"text": "The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.\n\nA buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod_proxy, which\ncan be triggered by receiving an invalid Content-Length header.  In order\nto exploit this issue, an attacker would need an Apache installation\nthat was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site.  This would\ncause the Apache child processing the request to crash.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0492 to this issue.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux platforms Red Hat believes this issue cannot\nlead to remote code execution.  This issue also does not represent a Denial\nof Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache\nchild processes.\n\nA stack buffer overflow was discovered in mod_ssl which can be triggered if\nusing the FakeBasicAuth option.  If mod_ssl is sent a client certificate\nwith a subject DN field longer than 6000 characters, a stack overflow can\noccur if FakeBasicAuth has been enabled.  In order to exploit this issue\nthe carefully crafted malicious certificate would have to be signed by a\nCertificate Authority which mod_ssl is configured to trust.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0488 to this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes a DNS handling bug in mod_proxy.\n\nThe mod_auth_digest module is now included in the Apache package and should\nbe used instead of mod_digest for sites requiring Digest authentication.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users of the Apache HTTP Server should upgrade\nto these erratum packages, which contains Apache version 1.3.27 with \nbackported patches correcting these issues.",
