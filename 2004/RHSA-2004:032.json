				"text": "Gaim is an instant messenger client that can handle multiple protocols.\n\nStefan Esser audited the Gaim source code and found a number of bugs that\nhave security implications.  Due to the nature of instant messaging many of\nthese bugs require man-in-the-middle attacks between client and server.\nHowever at least one of the buffer overflows could be exploited by an\nattacker sending a carefully-constructed malicious message through a server.\n\nThe issues include:\n\nMultiple buffer overflows that affect versions of Gaim 0.75 and earlier. \n1) When parsing cookies in a Yahoo web connection, 2) YMSG protocol\noverflows parsing the Yahoo login webpage, 3) a YMSG packet overflow, 4)\nflaws in the URL parser, and 5) flaws in HTTP Proxy connect.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0006 to these issues.\n\nA buffer overflow in Gaim 0.74 and earlier in the Extract Info\nField Function used for MSN and YMSG protocol handlers. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0007 to this issue.\n\nAn integer overflow in Gaim 0.74 and earlier, when allocating\nmemory for a directIM packet results in heap overflow.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0008 to this issue.\n\nAll users of Gaim should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security patches correcting these issues.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Steffan Esser for finding and reporting these\nissues and Jacques A. Vidrine for providing initial patches.",
