No exploit is currently available; however this\nissue is exploitable. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0077 to this issue.\n\nThe Vicam USB driver in kernel versions prior to 2.4.25 does not use the\ncopy_from_user function to access userspace, which crosses security\nboundaries.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0075 to this issue.\n\nArjan van de Ven discovered a flaw in ncp_lookup() in ncpfs that could\nallow local privilege escalation.  ncpfs is only used to allow a system to\nmount volumes of NetWare servers or print to NetWare printers.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0010 to this issue.\n\nAlan Cox found issues in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure that could\nallow local privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0003 to this issue.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain\nbackported security patches that correct these issues.   \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Paul Starzetz from ISEC for reporting the issue\nCAN-2004-0077.",
