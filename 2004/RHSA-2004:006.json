The KDE Personal Information Management (kdepim) suite helps you to\norganize your mail, tasks, appointments, and contacts. \n\nThe KDE team found a buffer overflow in the file information reader of\nVCF files. An attacker could construct a VCF file so that when it was\nopened by a victim it would execute arbitrary commands.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0988 to this issue.\n\nUsers of kdepim are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported security patch that corrects this issue.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt",
