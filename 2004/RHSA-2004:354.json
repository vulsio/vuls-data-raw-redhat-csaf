In the 2.4 kernel, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux, the only way this could happen is through the kernel nfs server.  A\nuser on a system that mounted a remote file system from a vulnerable\nmachine may be able to make unauthorized changes to the group ID of\nexported files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0497 to this issue.\n\nOnly Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems that are configured to share file\nsystems via NFS are affected by this issue.\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.  These packages contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt",
