				"text": "Stronghold 4 contains a number of open source technologies, including\nOpenSSL 0.9.6 and the Apache HTTP Server.\n\nTesting performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool\nuncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that can\nlead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop). The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0081 to this issue.\n\nTesting performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool\nuncovered a null-pointer assignment in the do_change_cipher_spec() function\nin OpenSSL 0.9.6c-0.9.6k and 0.9.7a-0.9.7c. A remote attacker could\nsend a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake which could lead to a denial of\nservice attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0079 to this issue.\n\nTesting performed by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC uncovered\nan issue in the ASN.1 parser in versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6l\nwhich could cause large recursion and possibly lead to a denial of service\nattack if used where stack space is limited. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0851\nto this issue.\n\nAn issue in the handling of regular expressions from configuration files\nwas discovered in releases of the Apache HTTP Server version 1.3 prior to\n1.3.29. To exploit this issue an attacker would need to have the ability\nto write to Apache configuration files such as .htaccess or httpd.conf. A\ncarefully-crafted configuration file can cause an exploitable buffer\noverflow and would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the\ncontext of the server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0542 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are advised to update to these errata\nversions, which contain backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to\nthese issues.",
