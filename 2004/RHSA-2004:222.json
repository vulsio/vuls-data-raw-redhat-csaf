				"category": "general",
				"text": "The kdelibs packages include libraries for the K Desktop Environment. \n\nKDE Libraries include: kdecore (KDE core library), kdeui (user interface),\nkfm (file manager), khtmlw (HTML widget), kio (Input/Output, networking),\nkspell (spelling checker), jscript (javascript), kab (addressbook), kimgio\n(image manipulation).  Konqueror is a file manager and Web browser for the\nK Desktop Environment (KDE).\n\niDEFENSE identified a vulnerability in the Opera web browser that could\nallow remote attackers to create or truncate arbitrary files. The KDE team\nhas found two similar vulnerabilities that also exist in KDE. \n\nA flaw in the telnet URI handler may allow options to be passed to the\ntelnet program, resulting in creation or replacement of files. An attacker\ncould create a carefully crafted link such that when opened by a victim it\ncreates or overwrites a file with the victim's permissions. \n\nA flaw in the mailto URI handler may allow options to be passed to the\nkmail program.  These options could cause kmail to write to the file system\nor to run on a remote X display.  An attacker could create a carefully\ncrafted link in such a way that access may be obtained to run arbitrary\ncode as the victim.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0411 to these issues.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 is only vulnerable to the mailto URI\nflaw as a previous update shipped without a telnet.protocol file.\n\nAll users of KDE are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported patch for these issues.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.
