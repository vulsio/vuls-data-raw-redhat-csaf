The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0554 to this issue.\n\nEnhancements were committed to the 2.6 kernel by Al Viro which enabled the\nSparse source code checking tool to check for a certain class of kernel\nbugs. A subset of these fixes also applies to various drivers in the 2.4\nkernel.  These flaws could lead to privilege escalation or access to kernel\nmemory.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2004-0495 to these issues.\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.  These packages contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.",
