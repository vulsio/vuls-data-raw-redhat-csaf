Note: Such files would have to be readable by the account used\nfor the connection.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0815 to this issue.\n\nThis issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 as a previous erratum\nupdated to Samba 3.0.6 which is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nUsers of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain an\nupgrade to Samba-2.2.12, which is not vulnerable to this issue.",
