An attacker could create a fake\nmalicious CVS server that would cause arbitrary files to be created or\noverwritten when a victim connects to it.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0180 to\nthis issue.\n\nDerek Price discovered a vulnerability whereby a CVS pserver could be\nabused by a malicious client to view the contents of certain files outside\nof the CVS root directory using relative pathnames containing \"../\".  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0405 to this issue.\n\nUsers of CVS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a patch correcting this issue.",
