A carefully created archive could\nallow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when a victim extracts or tests\nthe archive.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0769 to this issue.\n\nBuffer overflows were discovered in the command line processing of all\nversions of lha up to and including version 1.14.  If a malicious user can\ntrick a victim into passing a specially crafted command line to the lha\ncommand, it is possible that arbitrary code could be executed.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nnames CAN-2004-0771 and CAN-2004-0694 to these issues.\n\nThomas Biege discovered a shell meta character command execution\nvulnerability in all versions of lha up to and including 1.14.  An attacker\ncould create a directory with shell meta characters in its name which could\nlead to arbitrary command execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0745 to\nthis issue.\n\nUsers of lha should update to this updated package which contains\nbackported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.",
