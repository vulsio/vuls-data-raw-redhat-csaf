OpenH323 provides an implementation of the ITU H.323\nteleconferencing protocol, used by packages such as Gnome Meeting.\n\nA test suite for the H.225 protocol (part of the H.323 family) provided by\nthe NISCC uncovered bugs in PWLib prior to version 1.6.0.  An attacker\ncould trigger these bugs by sending carefully crafted messages to an\napplication.  The effects of such an attack can vary depending on the\napplication, but would usually result in a Denial of Service.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0097 to this issue.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security fixes and are not vulnerable to these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Craig Southeren of the OpenH323 project for\nproviding the fixes for these issues.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt",
