				"text": "Metamail is a system for handling multimedia mail.\n\nUlf Harnhammar discovered two format string bugs and two buffer overflow\nbugs in versions of Metamail up to and including 2.7.  An attacker could\ncreate a carefully-crafted message such that when it is opened by a victim\nand parsed through Metamail, it runs arbitrary code as the victim.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2004-0104 (format strings) and CAN-2004-0105 (buffer\noverflows) to these issues.\n\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 are advised to upgrade to these\nerratum packages, which contain a backported security patch and are not\nvulnerable to these issues.  Please note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3\ndoes not contain Metamail and is therefore not vulnerable to these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ulf Harnhammar for the notification and patch\nfor these issues.",
