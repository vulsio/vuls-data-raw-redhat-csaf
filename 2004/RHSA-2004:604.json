When\nreceiving unexpected sequence of MSNSLP messages, it is possible that an\nattacker could cause an internal buffer overflow, leading to a crash or\npossible code execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0891 to this issue.\n\nThis updated gaim package also fixes multiple user interface, protocol, and\nerror handling problems, including an ICQ communication encoding issue.\n\nAdditionally, these updated packages have compiled gaim as a PIE (position\nindependent executable) for added protection against future security\nvulnerabilities.\n\nAll users of gaim should upgrade to this updated package, which includes\nvarious bug fixes, as well as a backported security patch.",
