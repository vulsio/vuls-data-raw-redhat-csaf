Although Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 does not ship with the\nmysql-server package, the affected package is available from the Red Hat\nNetwork Extras channel. \n\nOleksandr Byelkin discovered that \"ALTER TABLE ... RENAME\" checked\nthe CREATE/INSERT rights of the old table instead of the new one. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0835 to this issue.\n\nLukasz Wojtow discovered a buffer overrun in the mysql_real_connect\nfunction. In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to force\nthe use of a malicious DNS server (CAN-2004-0836).\n\nDean Ellis discovered that multiple threads ALTERing the same (or\ndifferent) MERGE tables to change the UNION could cause the server to crash\nor stall (CAN-2004-0837).\n\nSergei Golubchik discovered that if a user is granted privileges to a\ndatabase with a name containing an underscore (\"_\"), the user also gains\nthe ability to grant privileges to other databases with similar names\n(CAN-2004-0957).\n\nUsers of mysql-server should upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncorrect these issues.",
