				"text": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and\nTransport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength\ngeneral purpose cryptography library.\n\nTesting performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool\nuncovered a null-pointer assignment in the do_change_cipher_spec() function\nin OpenSSL 0.9.6c-0.9.6l and 0.9.7a-0.9.7c.  A remote attacker could\nperform a carefully-crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server that used\nthe OpenSSL library in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Depending\non the application this could lead to a denial of service.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0079 to this issue.\n\nStephen Henson discovered a flaw in the SSL/TLS handshaking code when using\nKerberos ciphersuites in OpenSSL 0.9.7a-0.9.7c.  A remote attacker could\nperform a carefully-crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured\nto use Kerberos ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. \nMost applications have no ability to use Kerberos ciphersuites and are\ntherefore unaffected by this issue.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0112 to\nthis issue.\n\nTesting performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool\nuncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that can\nlead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop).  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0081 to this issue.  This issue affects only the OpenSSL\ncompatibility packages shipped with Red Hat Linux 9.\n\nThese updated packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that\nprotect against these issues.\n\nNOTE: Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are\nadvised to either restart all services using OpenSSL functionality or\nrestart their system after installing these updated packages.",
