				"text": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and\nTransport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength\ngeneral purpose cryptography library.\n\nTesting performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool\nuncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that can\nlead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop).  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0081 to this issue.\n\nTesting performed by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC uncovered\nan issue in the ASN.1 parser in versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6l\nwhich could cause large recursion and possibly lead to a denial of service\nattack if used where stack space is limited.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0851\nto this issue.\n\nThese updated packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that\nprotect against these issues.\n\nNOTE: Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are\nadvised to either restart all services using OpenSSL functionality or\nrestart their system after installing these updated packages.",
