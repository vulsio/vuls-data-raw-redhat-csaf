By exploiting\nthese issues it may be possible to make Ethereal crash by injecting an\nintentionally malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to\nread a malformed packet trace file.  It is not known if these issues could\nallow arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe SMB dissector in Ethereal before 0.10.0 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service via a malformed SMB packet that triggers a\nsegmentation fault during processing of Selected packets. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-1012 to this issue.\n\nThe Q.931 dissector in Ethereal before 0.10.0 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed Q.931, which triggers a\nnull dereference. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-1013 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Ethereal should update to these erratum packages containing\nEthereal version 0.10.0, which is not vulnerable to these issues.",
