				"text": "JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business\nprocess automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality.\n\nThis release of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0 serves as a replacement\nfor JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.1.0. It includes various bug fixes and\nenhancements which are detailed in the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0\nRelease Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from\nhttps://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in JRuby (a Java implementation\nof Ruby), which is included in the scripting_chain sample application. The\nsample application does not expose this flaw. If the version of JRuby\nshipped with the scripting_chain sample application was used to build a\ncustom application, a remote attacker could use this flaw to supply\nspecially-crafted input to that application, leading to the execution of\narbitrary HTML or web script. (CVE-2010-1330)\n\nNote: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform only provides JRuby as a dependency of\nthe scripting_chain quickstart. The CVE-2010-1330 flaw is not exposed\nunless the version of JRuby shipped with that quickstart is used by a\ndeployed, custom application.\n\nIt was found that the invoker servlets, deployed by default via\nhttpha-invoker, only performed access control on the HTTP GET and POST\nmethods, allowing remote attackers to make unauthenticated requests by\nusing different HTTP methods. Due to the second layer of authentication\nprovided by a security interceptor, this issue is not exploitable on\ndefault installations unless an administrator has misconfigured the\nsecurity interceptor or disabled it. (CVE-2011-4085)\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise\nSOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,\nconfiguration files, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.1.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform\n5.2.0.",
