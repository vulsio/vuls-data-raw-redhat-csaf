				"text": "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,\nwhich integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and\nJBoss Seam. OpenID4Java allows you to implement OpenID authentication in\nyour Java applications. OpenID4Java is a Technology Preview.\n\nThis JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 release serves as a\nreplacement for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1, and includes\nbug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform 5.1.2 Release Notes for information on the most significant of\nthese changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from\nhttps://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the invoker servlets, deployed by default via\nhttpha-invoker, only performed access control on the HTTP GET and POST\nmethods, allowing remote attackers to make unauthenticated requests by\nusing different HTTP methods. Due to the second layer of authentication\nprovided by a security interceptor, this issue is not exploitable on\ndefault installations unless an administrator has misconfigured the\nsecurity interceptor or disabled it. (CVE-2011-4085)\n\nIt was found that the Attribute Exchange (AX) extension of OpenID4Java was\nnot checking to ensure attributes were signed. If AX was being used to\nreceive information that an application only trusts the identity provider\nto assert, a remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct\nman-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the integrity of the information\nvia a specially-crafted request. By default, only the JBoss Seam openid\nexample application uses OpenID4Java. (CVE-2011-4314)\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up the\n\"jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/\" directory and any other customized\nconfiguration files of your JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 as provided from\nthe Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 5.1.2.",
