A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a\nspecially-crafted HTTP POST request to a deployed web service, causing\nexcessive CPU and memory consumption on the system hosting that service. If\nthe attack is repeated to consume all available network sockets, the server\nwill become unavailable. This flaw did not affect systems using JBoss Web\nServices CXF (provided by jboss-ep-ws-cxf-5.1.1-installer.zip).\n(CVE-2011-1483)\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 as provided from\nthe Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.",
