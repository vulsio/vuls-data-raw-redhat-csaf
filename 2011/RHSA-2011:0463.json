JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality.\n\nIt was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss\nExpression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing\narbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to\ncertain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly\nconfigured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of\nthis flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting\nthis issue.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3.0.CP04 and 5.1.0 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.",
