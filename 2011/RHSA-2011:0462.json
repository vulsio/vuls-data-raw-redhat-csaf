A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to\ncertain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly\nconfigured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of\nthis flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting\nthis issue.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0.CP09 and 5.1.0 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this\nupdate.",
