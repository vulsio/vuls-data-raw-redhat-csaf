				"category": "general",
				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Generic Receive Offload\n(GRO) functionality in the Linux kernel's networking implementation. If\nboth GRO and promiscuous mode were enabled on an interface in a virtual LAN\n(VLAN), it could result in a denial of service when a malformed VLAN frame\nis received on that interface. (CVE-2011-1478)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ryan Sweat for reporting CVE-2011-1478.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nsecurity issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for dbus issue\nCVE-2010-4352; kernel issues CVE-2010-4346, CVE-2011-0521, CVE-2011-0710,\nCVE-2011-1010, and CVE-2011-1090; libvirt issue CVE-2011-1146; and openldap\nissue CVE-2011-1024.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, network drivers that had Large Receive Offload (LRO) enabled\nby default caused the system to run slow when using software bridging. With\nthis update, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor disables LRO as a\npart of a modprobe configuration. (BZ#692864)\n\nAlso in this erratum, the rhev-hypervisor-pxe RPM has been dropped.\n\nAs Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor includes Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager Agent (VDSM), the bug fixes from the VDSM update\nRHBA-2011:0424 have been included in this update:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2011-0424.html\n\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which resolves these issues.",
