				"text": "JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the\nJava EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise\ncustomers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise\nMiddleware components that have been tested and certified together to\nprovide an integrated experience.\n\nThis release of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.1 serves as a\nreplacement to JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.0. It includes various\nbug fixes which are detailed in the Release Notes. The Release Notes will\nbe available shortly from the link in the References section.\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss\nExpression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing\narbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to\ncertain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly\nconfigured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of\nthis flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)\n\nIf you have created custom applications that are packaged with a copy of\nthe JBoss Seam 2 library, those applications must be rebuilt with the\nupdated jboss-seam.jar file provided by this update.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting\nCVE-2011-1484.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on\nJBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration\nfiles.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Portal\nPlatform 5.1.1.",
