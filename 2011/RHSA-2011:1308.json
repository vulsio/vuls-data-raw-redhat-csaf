It implements the JAX-WS specification.\n\nIt was found that JBoss Web Services Native did not properly protect\nagainst recursive entity resolution when processing Document Type\nDefinitions (DTD). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a\nspecially-crafted HTTP POST request to a deployed web service, causing\nexcessive CPU and memory consumption on the system hosting that service. If\nthe attack is repeated to consume all available network sockets, the server\nwill become unavailable. (CVE-2011-1483)\n\nAll users of JBoss Communications Platform 1.2.11 and 5.1.1 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.",
