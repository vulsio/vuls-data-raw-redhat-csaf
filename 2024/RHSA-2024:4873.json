This issue can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.

					"text": "The vulnerability in webpack-dev represents a important security issue due to its potential to expose sensitive files and compromise developer machines. By failing to validate URLs and normalize paths effectively, the middleware allows attackers to craft malicious requests that can retrieve arbitrary local files or perform unauthorized path traversal. This could lead to unauthorized access to confidential information, including source code, configuration files, and even system-level files. Given the widespread use of webpack-dev-middleware in web development environments, addressing this vulnerability promptly is important to prevent serious data breaches and protect the integrity of development processes.",
