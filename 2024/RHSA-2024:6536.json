				"text": "Red Hat AMQ Streams, based on the Apache Kafka project, offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share data with extremely high throughput and extremely low latency. \n\nThis release of Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.5.2 serves as a replacement for Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.5.1, and includes security and bug fixes, and enhancements.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* Scala: sbt is a build tool for Scala, Java, and others. Given a specially crafted zip or JAR file, `IO.unzip` allows writing of arbitrary file. This would have potential to overwrite `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Within sbt's main code, `IO.unzip` is used in `pullRemoteCache` task and `Resolvers.remote`; however many projects use `IO.unzip(...)` directly to implement custom tasks. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.9.7.(CVE-2023-46122)\n\n* ZooKeeper: Information disclosure in persistent watcher handling. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.\n(CVE-2024-23944)\n\n* ZooKeeper: Authorization Bypass in Apache ZooKeeper [amq-st-2](CVE-2023-44981)\n\n* Snappy: flaw was found in SnappyInputStream in snappy-java. This issue occurs when decompressing data with a too-large chunk size due to a missing upper bound check on chunk length. An unrecoverable fatal error can occur, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Kafka: snappy-java: Unchecked chunk length leads to DoS [amq-st-2](CVE-2023-34455), (CVE-2024-27309), (CVE-2024-31141)\n\n* Strimzi Operators: vertx-core: io.vertx:vertx-core: memory leak when a TCP server is configured with TLS and SNI support (CVE-2024-1300)\n\n* Strimzi Bridge: flaw was found in SnappyInputStream in snappy-java (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Strimzi Bridge: netty-codec-http: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CVE-2024-29025)\n\n* Strimzi Bridge: vertx-core: io.vertx:vertx-core: memory leak when a TCP server is configured with TLS and SNI support (CVE-2024-1300)\n\n* Strimzi Bridge: netty-codec-http2: HTTP/2: Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (CVE-2023-44487)\n \n* Strimzi Bridge: Bump snappy-java to fix (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Strimzi OAuth: In Connect2id Nimbus JOSE+JWT before 9.37.2, an attacker can cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a large JWE p2c header value (aka iteration count) for the PasswordBasedDecrypter (PBKDF2) component. (CVE-2023-52428)\n\n* Cruise Control: flaw was found in SnappyInputStream in snappy-java (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Cruise Control: jose4j- denial of service via specially crafted JWE (CVE-2023-51775)\n \n* Cruise Control: Bump snappy-java to fix (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Cruise Control: cruise-control reported a high-sev json vulnerability (CVE-2023-5072)\n\n* Cruise Control: Nimbus JOSE+JWT before 9.37.2 (CVE-2023-52428)\n\n* Strimzi Kafka Kubernetes Config Provider: Bump snappy-java to fix (CVE-2023-43642)",
