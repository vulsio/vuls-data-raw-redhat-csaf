					"text": "A flaw was found in the io.netty:netty-codec-http package. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling issues due to the accumulation of data in the HttpPostRequestDecoder. The decoder cumulates bytes in the undecodedChunk buffer until it can decode a field, allowing data to accumulate without limits. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending a chunked post consisting of many small fields that will be accumulated in the bodyListHttpData list.",

					"text": "The vulnerability in io.netty:netty-codec-http, allowing for Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling issues, is assessed as moderate severity due to its potential impact on system availability and performance. By exploiting the flaw in HttpPostRequestDecoder, an attacker can craft chunked POST requests with numerous small fields, causing excessive accumulation of data in memory buffers. This unrestricted accumulation can lead to significant memory consumption on the server, potentially exhausting available resources and resulting in denial of service (DoS) conditions.",
