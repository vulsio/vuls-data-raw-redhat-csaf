Unlike\nSSL (aka TLS), the SSH2 protocol does not require heirarchical certificates\nsigned by a powerful central authority. You may know SSH2 as the protocol\nthat replaced telnet and rsh for secure access to remote shells, but the\nprotocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote\nservices across an encrypted tunnel. This is how sftp works, for example.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Prefix truncation attack on Binary Packet Protocol (BPP) (CVE-2023-48795)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE\npage listed in the References section.",

It only allows the deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this protocol stage prevents user authentication from proceeding, leading to a stalled connection.\n\nThe most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke timing obfuscation features. However, there is no other observable impact on session secrecy or session integrity.",
