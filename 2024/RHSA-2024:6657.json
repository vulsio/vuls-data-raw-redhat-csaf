Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling issues due to the accumulation of data in the HttpPostRequestDecoder. The decoder cumulates bytes in the undecodedChunk buffer until it can decode a field, allowing data to accumulate without limits. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending a chunked post consisting of many small fields that will be accumulated in the bodyListHttpData list.",

By exploiting the flaw in HttpPostRequestDecoder, an attacker can craft chunked POST requests with numerous small fields, causing excessive accumulation of data in memory buffers.
