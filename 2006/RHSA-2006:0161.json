				"text": "Red Hat Application Server packages provide a J2EE Application Server and\nWeb container as well as the underlying Java stack.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Tomcat displays\ndirectory listings. A remote attacker could cause Tomcat to consume large\namounts of CPU resources by sending multiple requests for a directory\ncontaining a large number of files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the name CVE-2005-3510 to this issue.\nThis update contains a version of Apache Tomcat that will recover after\nthe aforementioned attack. Users are also advised to disable directory\nlisting for web directories that contain very large numbers of files.\n\nA cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Struts displays error\npages. It may be possible for an attacker to construct a specially crafted\nURL which could fool a victim into believing they are viewing a trusted\nsite. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the\nname CVE-2005-3745 to this issue. Please note that this issue does not\naffect Struts running on Tomcat or JOnAS, which is our supported usage of\nStruts.\n\nAdditionally, this update replaces some other outdated packages with new\nversions. Several bug fixes and enhancements are included in these new\nversions.\n\nIMPORTANT: Before applying this update, read the detailed\ninstallation/upgrade instructions in the RELEASE_NOTES document.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Application Server should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain packages that are not vulnerable to these issues.",
