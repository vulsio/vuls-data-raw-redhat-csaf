(CVE-2004-1073, moderate). Red Hat originally reported this\nflaw as being fixed by RHSA-2004:504, but a patch for this issue was\nmissing from that update.\n\n- a potential leak of kernel data from ext2 file system handling\n(CVE-2005-0400, low) \n\n- flaws in ISO-9660 file system handling that allowed the mounting of\nan invalid image on a CD-ROM to cause a denial of service (crash)\nor potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2005-0815, moderate) \n\n- a flaw in gzip/zlib handling internal to the kernel that may allow a\nlocal user to cause a denial of service (crash) (CVE-2005-2458, low) \n\n- a flaw in exec() handling on some 64-bit architectures that allowed a\nlocal user to cause a denial of service (crash) (CVE-2005-2708, important) \n\n- a flaw in procfs handling during unloading of modules that allowed a\nlocal user to cause a denial of service or potentially gain privileges\n(CVE-2005-2709, moderate) \n\n- a flaw in IPv6 network UDP port hash table lookups that allowed a local\nuser to cause a denial of service (hang) (CVE-2005-2973, important) \n\n- a network buffer info leak using the orinoco driver that allowed a remote\nuser to possibly view uninitialized data (CVE-2005-3180, important) \n\n- a race condition affecting SMP systems that allowed a local user to cause\na denial of service (crash) (CVE-2005-3274, important)\n\n- a flaw in IPv4 network TCP and UDP netfilter handling that allowed a\nlocal user to cause a denial of service (crash) (CVE-2005-3275, important) \n\n- a flaw in the IPv6 flowlabel code that allowed a local user to cause a\ndenial of service (crash) (CVE-2005-3806, important) \n\nThe following bugs were also addressed:\n\n- Handle set_brk() errors in binfmt_elf\n\n- Correct scsi error return\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.",
