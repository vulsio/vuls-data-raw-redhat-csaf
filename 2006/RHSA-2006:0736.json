(CVE-2006-5465) \n\nA response-splitting issue was discovered in the PHP session handling. If\na remote attacker can force a carefully crafted session identifier to be\nused, a cross-site-scripting or response-splitting attack could be\npossible. (CVE-2006-3016)\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered found in the PHP sscanf() function.
