The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2006-0150\nto this issue.\n\nNote that this issue only affects servers that have auth_ldap installed and\nconfigured to perform user authentication against an LDAP database.\n\nAll users of auth_ldap should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to resolve this issue.\n\nThis issue does not affect the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or 4\ndistributions as they do not include the auth_ldap package.",
