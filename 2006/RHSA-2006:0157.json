The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the\nname CVE-2005-3745 to this issue. Please note that this issue does not\naffect Struts running on Tomcat or JOnAS, which is our supported usage of\nStruts.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Application Server should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain Struts version 1.2.8 which is not vulnerable to\nthis issue.",
