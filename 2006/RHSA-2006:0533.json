				"text": "GNU Zebra is a free software that manages TCP/IP based routing protocol.\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way GNU Zebra interprets\nRIP REQUEST packets. RIPd in GNU Zebra will respond to RIP REQUEST packets\nfor RIP versions that have been disabled or that have authentication\nenabled, allowing a remote attacker to acquire information about the local\nnetwork. (CVE-2006-2223)\n\nA route injection flaw was found in the way GNU Zebra interprets RIPv1\nRESPONSE packets when RIPv2 authentication is enabled. It is possible for a\nremote attacker to inject arbitrary route information into the RIPd routing\ntables. This issue does not affect GNU Zebra configurations where only\nRIPv2 is specified. (CVE-2006-2224)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in GNU Zebra's telnet interface. If an\nattacker is able to connect to the GNU Zebra telnet interface, it is\npossible to cause GNU Zebra to consume vast quantities of CPU resources by\nissuing a malformed 'sh' command. (CVE-2006-2276)\n\nUsers of GNU Zebra should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that correct these issues.",
