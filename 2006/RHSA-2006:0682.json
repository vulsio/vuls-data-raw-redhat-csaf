				"text": "PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nA response-splitting issue was discovered in the PHP session handling.  If\na remote attacker can force a carefully crafted session identifier to be\nused, a cross-site-scripting or response-splitting attack could be\npossible.  (CVE-2006-3016)\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered found in the PHP sscanf() function.  If a\nscript used the sscanf() function with positional arguments in the format\nstring, a remote attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache' user.  (CVE-2006-4020)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP wordwrap() and str_repeat()\nfunctions.  If a script running on a 64-bit server used either of these\nfunctions on untrusted user data, a remote attacker sending a carefully\ncrafted request might be able to cause a heap overflow.  (CVE-2006-4482)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory allocation handling. \nOn 64-bit platforms, the \"memory_limit\" setting was not enforced correctly,\nwhich could allow a denial of service attack by a remote user.  (CVE-2006-4486)\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.  These packages also contain a\nfix for a bug where certain input strings to the metaphone() function could\ncause memory corruption.",
