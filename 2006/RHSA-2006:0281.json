If it is possible for a remote\nattacker to reference the public getMultipartRequestHandler method, the\nattacker can prevent the Struts application from functioning properly.\n(CVE-2006-1547)\n\nA cross site scripting bug was found in the way Struts displays certain\nerror messages via its LookupDispatchAction, DispatchAction, and\nActionDispatcher handler. It may be possible for an attacker to construct a\nspecially crafted URL that could fool a victim into believing they are\nviewing a trusted site.
