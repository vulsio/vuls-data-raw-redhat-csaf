If a user visits a malicious web page, Mozilla could\ncrash or execute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2006-0292 to\nthis issue.\n\nmoz_bug_r_a4 discovered a bug in Mozilla's XULDocument.persist() function.\nA malicious web page could inject arbitrary RDF data into a user's\nlocalstore.rdf file, which can cause Mozilla to execute arbitrary\njavascript when a user runs Mozilla.  (CVE-2006-0296)\n\nA denial of service bug was found in the way Mozilla saves history\ninformation. If a user visits a web page with a very long title, it is\npossible Mozilla will crash or take a very long time the next time it is\nrun.  (CVE-2005-4134)\n\nNote that the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 packages also fix a bug when\nusing XSLT to transform documents. Passing DOM Nodes as parameters to\nfunctions expecting an xsl:param could cause Mozilla to throw an exception.\n\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
