				"text": "Ghostscript is a program for displaying PostScript files or printing them\nto non-PostScript printers.\n\nAn untrusted PostScript file can cause ghostscript to execute arbitrary\ncommands due to insufficient checking. Since ghostscript is often used\nduring the course of printing a document (and is run as user lp), all\nusers should install the packages contained in this erratum.\n\nThe problem was fixed in the 6.53 source release of GNU Ghostscript, and\nthe fix has been backported and applied to the packages referenced by this\nadvisory.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0363 to this issue.\n\nPlease note that this vulnerability is different to the \"local file read\"\nissue corrected by our previous Ghostscript errata (RHSA-2001:112 and\nRHSA-2001:138)\n\nA flaw in unpatched versions of Ghostscript before 7.07 allows malicious\npostscript files to execute arbitrary commands even with -dSAFER enabled.\nNote that this vulnerability does not affect Ghostscript when the Red Hat\n-dPARANOIDSAFER option is used. Therefore, a malicious print job cannot be\nused to exploit this vulnerability under Red Hat Linux.\n\nUsers of Ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain a backported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.",
