These vulnerabilities\nallow remote attackers to run arbitrary commands as the user under which\nthe Web server is running.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0084 to these issues.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which change the\nmethod by which external programs are invoked and, therefore, make these\nprograms invulnerable to these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Daniel Jarboe and Maneesh Sahani for bringing\nthese issues to our attention.",

Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
