On systems where shared memory or other\ninter-process communication mechanisms are not available, the MM library\nemulates them using temporary files.  MM is used in Red Hat Linux to \nproviding shared memory pools to Apache modules.\n\nVersions of MM up to and including 1.1.3 open temporary files in an unsafe\nmanner, allowing a malicious local user to cause an application that uses\nMM to overwrite any file to which it has write access.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain a\npatched version of MM that is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nThanks to Marcus Meissner for providing a patch for this issue.",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
