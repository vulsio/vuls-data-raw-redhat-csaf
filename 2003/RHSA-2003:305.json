The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0795 to this issue. \n \nHerbert Xu reported that Zebra can accept spoofed messages sent on the\nkernel netlink interface by other users on the local machine.  This could\nlead to a local denial of service attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0858 to\nthis issue. \n \nUsers of Zebra should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\na patch preventing Zebra from crashing when it receives a telnet option\ndelimiter without any option data, and a patch that checks that netlink\nmessages actually came from the kernel.",
