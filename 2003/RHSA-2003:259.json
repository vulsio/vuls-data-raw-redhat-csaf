The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the names CAN-2003-0548 and CAN-2003-0549 to these issues.\n\nThis attack is only possible if XDMCP is enabled. XDMCP is not enabled by\ndefault in Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions.  In addition is\ndocumented best practise that XDMCP should only ever be run on trusted\nnetworks.\n\nUsers of XDMCP in GDM should upgrade to these erratum packages which\ncontain backported security fixes are are not vulnerable to these issues.\n\nNote that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 is not vulnerable to CAN-2003-0547,\na vulnerability that allows a local user to read any text file, as it did\nnot have the \"examine session errors\" feature.",
