				"text": "Hangul Terminal is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, based on Xterm.\n\nHangul Terminal provides an escape sequence for reporting the current\nwindow title, which essentially takes the current title and places it\ndirectly on the command line.  An attacker can craft an escape sequence\nthat sets the window title of a victim using Hangul Terminal to an\narbitrary command and then report it to the command line.   Since it is not\npossible to embed a carriage return into the window title the attacker\nwould then have to convince the victim to press Enter for it to process the\ntitle as a command, although the attacker could craft other escape\nsequences that might convince the victim to do so.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to lock up Hangul Terminal before version 2.0.5\nby sending an invalid DEC UDK escape sequence.  \n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nHangul Terminal version 2.0.5.",
