The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0001 to this issue.\n\nThe Linux 2.2 kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service\n(crash) by using the mmap() function with a PROT_READ parameter to access\nnon-readable memory pages through the /proc/pid/mem interface.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2002-1380 to this issue.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7 should upgrade to these errata\npackages, which contain version 2.2.24 of the Linux kernel with patches and\nare not vulnerable to these issues.",
