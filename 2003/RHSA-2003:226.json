The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0085 to\nthis issue.\n\nThe code for writing reg files in Samba before 2.2.8 allows local users to\noverwrite arbitrary files via a race condition involving chown.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0086 to this issue.\n\nMultiple buffer overflows in Samba before 2.2.8a may allow remote attackers\nto execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service, as discovered by\nthe Samba team during a code audit.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0196 to\nthis issue.\n\nA buffer overflow in the call_trans2open function allows remote attackers\nto execute arbitrary code.
