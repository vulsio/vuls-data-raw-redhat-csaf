Since the code for pdftops\nis taken from the Xpdf project, all versions of Xpdf including 2.01 are\nalso vulnerable to this issue.  An attacker could create a PDF\nfile that could execute arbitrary code.  This could would have the same\naccess privileges as the user who viewed the file with Xpdf.\n\nAll users of Xpdf are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages.  For\nRed Hat Linux 8.0 we have included new packages based on Xpdf 1.01 with a\npatch to correct this issue.  For Red Hat Linux 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 we\nhave upgraded Xpdf to version 1.00 with a patch to correct this issue.  For\nRed Hat Linux 6.2 we have upgraded Xpdf to version 0.92 with a patch to\ncorrect this issue.",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
