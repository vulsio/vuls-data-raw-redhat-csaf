If a user uses uudecode to\nextract data into open shared directories, such as /tmp, this vulnerability\ncould be used by a local attacker to overwrite files or lead to privilege\nescalation.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
