				"text": "Kerberos is a network authentication system. The MIT Kerberos team\nreleased an advisory describing a number of vulnerabilities that affect the\nkerberos packages shipped as part of Red Hat Linux 9. These issues include:\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the triple-DES key support found in the\nimplementation of the Kerberos IV authentication protocol included in MIT\nKerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0139 to this issue.\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the Kerberos IV authentication protocol\nwhich allow an attacker with knowledge of a cross-realm key, which is\nshared with another realm, to impersonate any principal in that realm to\nany service in that realm. This vulnerability can only be closed by\ndisabling cross-realm authentication in Kerberos IV (CAN-2003-0138).\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the RPC library used by the kadmin\nservice in Kerberos 5. A faulty length check in the RPC library exposes\nkadmind to an integer overflow which can be used to crash kadmind\n(CAN-2003-0028).\n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers\nto cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm via a\ncertain protocol request that causes the KDC to corrupt its heap\n(CAN-2003-0082).  \n\nAll users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich disable cross-realm authentication by default for Kerberos IV and\nwhich contain patches that correct these issues.",
