				"text": "PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP server. \n\nThe mail function in PHP 4.x to 4.2.2 may allow local script authors to\nbypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to an\nMTA (such as Sendmail).  Specifically, the fifth argument to mail() may be\nmodified, altering MTA behavior and possibly allowing the execution of\narbitrary local commands.\n\nThe mail function in PHP 4.x to 4.2.2 does not filter ASCII control\ncharacters from its arguments, which could allow remote attackers to\nmodify mail message content, including mail headers, and possibly use\nPHP as a \"spam proxy.\"\n\nScript authors should note that all input should be checked for unsafe data\nby any PHP scripts calling functions such as mail().\n\nPHP versions 4.0.5 through 4.1.0 in safe mode do not properly cleanse\nthe 5th parameter to the mail() function. This vulnerability allows local\nusers and possibly remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell\nmetacharacters.\n\nNote that this PHP errata enforces memory limits on the size of the PHP\nprocess to prevent a badly generated script from becoming a possible source\nfor a denial of service attack. The default process size is 8MB, though you\ncan adjust this as necessary through the php.ini directive memory_limit.\nFor example, to change the process memory limit to 4MB, add\nthe following:\n\nmemory_limit 4194304\n\nImportant Note:\n\nYour original /etc/php.ini configuration file is not replaced or\noverwritten. Therefore, you should carefully review your configuration file\nand adapt it as necessary to your server or service functions.",
