				"text": "The libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files. PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format. \n\nUnpatched versions of libpng 1.2.1 and earlier do not correctly calculate\noffsets, which leads to a buffer overflow and the possibility of arbitrary\ncode execution.  This could be exploited by an attacker creating a\ncarefully crafted PNG file which could execute arbitrary code when the\nvictim views it.\n\nPackages within Red Hat Linux, such as Mozilla, make use of the shared\nlibpng library. Therefore, all users are advised to upgrade to the errata\npackages.  For Red Hat Linux 8.0 the packages contain libpng 1.2.2 which is\nnot vulnerable to this issue.  For Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3\nthe packages contain libpng 1.0.14 with a backported patch that corrects\nthis issue.",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
