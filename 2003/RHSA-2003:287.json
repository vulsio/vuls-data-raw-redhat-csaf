				"category": "general",
				"text": "XFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System providing the core\ngraphical user interface and video drivers in Red Hat Linux. XDM is the X\ndisplay manager.\n\nMultiple integer overflows in the transfer and enumeration of font\nlibraries in XFree86 allow local or remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice or execute arbitrary code via heap-based and stack-based buffer\noverflow attacks.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0730 to this issue.  \n\nThe risk to users from this vulnerability is  limited because only clients\ncan be affected by these bugs, however in some (non default)\nconfigurations, both xfs and the X Server can act as clients\nto remote font servers.\n\nXDM does not verify whether the pam_setcred function call succeeds, which\nmay allow attackers to gain root privileges by triggering error conditions\nwithin PAM modules, as demonstrated in certain configurations of the\npam_krb5 module.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0690 to this issue.  \n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated XFree86 4.2.1 packages, which\ncontain backported security patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.",
