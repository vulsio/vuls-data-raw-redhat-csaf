				"text": "Kerberos is a network authentication system. The MIT Kerberos team\nreleased an advisory describing a number of vulnerabilities that affect the\nkerberos packages shipped by Red Hat. These vulnerabilities include:\n\nAn integer signedness error in the ASN.1 decoder before version 1.2.5\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large\nunsigned data element length, which is later used as a negative value. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0036 to this issue. \n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) before version 1.2.5 allows remote,\nauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within\nthe same realm using a certain protocol request that causes a null\ndereference (CAN-2003-0058). \n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a\ncertain protocol request that causes an out-of-bounds read of an array\n(CAN-2003-0072).\n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers\nto cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a\ncertain protocol request that causes the KDC to corrupt its heap\n(CAN-2003-0082).\n\nA vulnerability in Kerberos before version 1.2.3 allows users from one\nrealm to impersonate users in other realms that have the same inter-realm\nkeys (CAN-2003-0059). \n\nThe MIT advisory for these issues also mentions format string\nvulnerabilities in the logging routines (CAN-2003-0060). Previous versions\nof the kerberos packages from Red Hat already contain fixes for this issue.\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the support for triple-DES keys in the\nimplementation of the Kerberos IV authentication protocol, which is\nincluded in MIT Kerberos (CAN-2003-0139).\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the Kerberos IV authentication protocol\nthat allow an attacker with knowledge of a cross-realm key, which is\nshared with another realm, to impersonate any principal in that realm to\nany service in that realm. This vulnerability can only be closed by\ndisabling cross-realm authentication in Kerberos IV (CAN-2003-0138).\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the RPC library used by the kadmin\nservice in Kerberos 5. A faulty length check in the RPC library exposes\nkadmind to an integer overflow, which can be used to crash kadmind\n(CAN-2003-0028).\n\nThe Kerberos 5 network authentication system contains an RPC library which\nincludes an XDR decoder derived from Sun's RPC implementation. The Sun\nimplementation was recently demonstrated to be vulnerable to a heap\noverflow. It is believed that the attacker needs to be able to\nauthenticate to the kadmin daemon for this attack to be successful\n(CVE-2002-0391).\n\nA stack buffer overflow was found in the implementation of the Kerberos v4\ncompatibility administration daemon (kadmind4), which is part of the the\nMIT krb5 distribution, but not enabled or used by default in Red Hat Linux.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited to gain unauthorized root access to a\nKDC host. The attacker does not need to authenticate to the daemon to\nsuccessfully perform this attack (CAN-2002-1235).\n\nA problem has been found in the Kerberos ftp client. When retrieving a\nfile with a filename beginning with a pipe character, the ftp client will\npass the filename to the command shell in a system() call. This could\nallow a malicious ftp server to write to files outside of the current\ndirectory or execute commands as the user running the ftp client\n(CAN-2003-0041).\n\nAll users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich disable cross-realm authentication by default for Kerberos IV and\nwhich contain backported patches that correct these issues.",
