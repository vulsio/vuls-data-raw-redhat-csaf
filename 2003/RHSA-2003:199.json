				"category": "general",
				"text": "The unzip utility is used for manipulating archives, which are multiple\nfiles stored inside of a single file.\n\nA vulnerabilitiy in unzip version 5.50 and earlier allows attackers to\noverwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction by placing invalid\n(non-printable) characters between two \".\" characters.  These non-printable\ncharacters are filtered, resulting in a \"..\" sequence.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0282 to this issue.\n\nThis erratum includes a patch ensuring that non-printable characters do not\nmake it possible for a malicious .zip file to write to parent directories\nunless the \"-:\" command line parameter is specified.\n\nUsers of unzip are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which are\nnot vulnerable to this issue.",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
