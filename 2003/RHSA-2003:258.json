				"text": "GDM is the GNOME Display Manager for X.\n\nVersions of GDM prior to 2.4.1.6 contain a bug where GDM will run as root\nwhen examining the ~/.xsession-errors file when using the \"examine session\nerrors\" feature, allowing local users the ability to read any text file\non the system by creating a symlink. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0547 to\nthis issue.\n\nRed Hat Linux 8.0 and 9 are vulnerable to this issue. Versions of GDM in\nearlier releases did not have the \"examine session errors\" feature and\ntherefore are not vulnerable to this issue. \n\nAlso addressed by these erratum packages are two problems in the X Display\nManager Control Protocol (XDMCP) which allow a denial of service attack\n(DoS) by crashing the gdm daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2003-0548 and\nCAN-2003-0549 to these issues.\n\nThis attack is only possible if XDMCP is enabled. XDMCP is not enabled by\ndefault in Red Hat Linux distributions, and as documented XDMCP should only\never be run on trusted networks.\n\nUsers of GDM are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which disable\nthe \"examine session errors\" feature and contain backported security fixes\nfor the XDMCP issues.",
