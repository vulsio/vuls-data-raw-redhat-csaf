When retrieving a\nfile with a name beginning with a pipe character, the FTP client will\npass the file name to the command shell in a system() call. This could\nallow a malicious FTP server to write to files outside of the current\ndirectory or execute commands as the user running the FTP client.\n\nThe Kerberos FTP client runs as the default FTP client when the Kerberos\npackage krb5-workstation is installed on a Red Hat Linux Advanced Server\ndistribution.\n\nAll users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a backported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.",
