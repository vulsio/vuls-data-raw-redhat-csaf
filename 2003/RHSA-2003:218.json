				"category": "general",
				"text": "The unzip and tar utilities are used for manipulating archives, which are\nmultiple files stored inside of a single file.\n\nA directory traversal vulnerability in unzip version 5.42 and earlier, as\nwell as GNU tar 1.13.19 and earlier, allows attackers to overwrite\narbitrary files during archive extraction via a \"..\" (dot dot) in an\nextracted filename. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2001-1267 and CAN-2001-1268 to\nthis issue. \n\nIn addition, unzip version 5.42 and earlier also allows attackers to\noverwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction via filenames in the\narchive that begin with the \"/\" (slash) character. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2001-1269 to this issue.\n\nDuring testing of the fix to GNU tar, it was discovered that GNU tar\n1.13.25 was still vulnerable to a modified version of the same problem. Red\nHat has provided a patch to tar 1.13.25 to correct this problem. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0399 to this issue.\n\nGNU tar 1.13.19 and other versions before 1.13.25  allow remote attackers\nto overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack, as the result of a\nmodification that effectively disabled the security check.  This issue\naffects only Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1216 to\nthis issue.\n\nA vulnerabilitiy in unzip version 5.50 and earlier allows attackers to\noverwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction by placing invalid\n(non-printable) characters between two \".\" characters. These non-printable\ncharacters are filtered, resulting in a \"..\" sequence. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0282 to this issue.\n\nThis erratum also includes a patch ensuring that non-printable characters\ndo not make it possible for a malicious .zip file to write to parent\ndirectories unless the \"-:\" command line parameter is specified.\n\nUsers of unzip and tar are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich contain patched versions of unzip and GNU tar that are not vulnerable\nto these issues.",
