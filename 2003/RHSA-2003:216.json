Since the code for pdftops is\ntaken from the Xpdf project, all versions of Xpdf including 2.01 are also\nvulnerable to this issue. An attacker could create a PDF file that could\nexecute arbitrary code. This code would have the same access privileges as\nthe user who viewed the file with Xpdf.\n\nMartyn Gilmore discovered a flaw in various PDF viewers and readers.  An\nattacker can embed malicious external-type hyperlinks that, if activated or\nfollowed by a victim, can execute arbitrary shell commands.   The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0434 to this issue.\n\nAll users of Xpdf are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a patch correcting this issue.",
