				"text": "The fileutils package contains several basic system utilities. One of\nthese utilities is the \"ls\" program, which is used to list information\nabout files and directories. In Red Hat Linux 9, the ls program is part of\nthe coreutils package.\n\nGeorgi Guninski discovered a memory starvation denial of service\nvulnerability in the ls program.  It is possible to make ls allocate a\nhuge amount of memory by specifying certain command line arguments.  This\nvulnerability is remotely exploitable through services like wu-ftpd, which\npass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0854 to this issue.\n\nA non-exploitable integer overflow in ls has also been discovered.  It is\npossible to make ls crash by specifying certain command line arguments. \nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable through services like wu-ftpd,\nwhich pass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0853 to this issue.\n\nThis erratum contains new fileutils packages for Red Hat Linux versions\n7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0.  It also contains new coreutils packages for Red\nHat Linux 9.  These packages contain backported patches correcting these\nvulnerabilities.\n\nThe Red Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3 packages also add support for the\nO_DIRECT flag, which controls the use of synchronous I/O on file systems\nsuch as OCFS.",
