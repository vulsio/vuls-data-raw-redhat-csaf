This program contains several\nvulnerabilities.\n\nNOTE: Although the SANE packages include this program, it is not used by\ndefault under Red Hat Linux.\n\nThe IP address of the remote host is only checked after the first\ncommunication occurs, causing saned.conf restrictions to be ineffective for\nthe first communication.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0773 to this issue.\n\nA connection that is dropped early causes one of several problems.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2003-0774, CAN-2003-0775, and CAN-2003-0777 to these issues.\n\nLack of error checking can cause various other unfavorable consequences. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2003-0776 and CAN-2003-0778 to these issues.\n\nAdditionally, the updated packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0 include a fix for\na bug that could cause hardware damage to Epson 1260 scanners.  Releases\nprior to Red Hat Linux 8.0 are unaffected by this issue.  Red Hat Linux 9\nis affected by this, but will be covered by a separate advisory.\n\nUsers of SANE (particularly those that use saned for remote scanner access)\nshould upgrade to these errata packages, which resolve these issues.",

					"details": "Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt",
