This is\ndue to the fact that the redefined @_ variable is not reset between\nsuccessive calls. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1323 to this issue.\n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in the start_form()\nfunction of CGI.pm. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to insert a\nWeb script via a URL fed into the form's action parameter. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0615 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Perl are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain Perl 5.6.1 with backported security patches correcting these issues.",
