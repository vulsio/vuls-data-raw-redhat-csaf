				"text": "The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.\n\nThe Apache Web server before 1.3.25 does not prevent escape sequences from\nbeing written to the error and access logs.  This could allow an attacker\nto embed arbitrary escape sequences into the log file.  A recent paper by\nHD Moore highlighted several issues where common terminal emulator software\n(such as xterm) can be remotely abused or exploited by displaying arbitrary\nescape sequences. \n\nIf Apache is configured to act as a reverse proxy by specifying the backend\nserver using a numeric IP address, the mod_proxy module will perform a\nredundant reverse DNS lookup on the IP address, causing a delay in request\nprocessing.\n\nUsers are advised to install these updated packages which contain: a\npatched version of Apache which prevents control characters from being \nwritten to log files; and a patched version of mod_proxy which does not\nperform reverse DNS lookups unless necessary.",
