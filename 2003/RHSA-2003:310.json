				"text": "The fileutils package contains several basic system utilities. One of\nthese utilities is the \"ls\" program, which is used to list information\nabout files and directories. \n\nGeorgi Guninski discovered a memory starvation denial of service\nvulnerability in the ls program.  It is possible to make ls allocate a\nhuge amount of memory by specifying certain command line arguments.  This\nvulnerability is remotely exploitable through services like wu-ftpd, which\npass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0854 to this issue.\n\nA non-exploitable integer overflow in ls has been discovered.  It is\npossible to make ls crash by specifying certain command line arguments. \nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable through services like wu-ftpd,\nwhich pass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0853 to this issue.\n\nUsers are advised to update to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security patches that correct these vulnerabilities.\n\nThese packages also add support for the O_DIRECT flag, which controls the\nuse of synchronous I/O on file systems such as OCFS.",
