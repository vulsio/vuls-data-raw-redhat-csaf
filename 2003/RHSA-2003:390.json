				"text": "GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.\n\nPhong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses\nElGamal keys, when those keys are used both to sign and encrypt data.  This\nvulnerability can be used to trivially recover the private key.  While the\ndefault behavior of GnuPG when generating keys does not lead to the\ncreation of unsafe keys, by overriding the default settings an unsafe key\ncould have been created.\n\nIf you are using ElGamal keys, you should revoke those keys immediately.\n\nThe packages included in this update do not make ElGamal keys safe to use;\nthey merely include a patch by David Shaw that disables functions that\nwould generate or use ElGamal keys.\n\nTo determine if your key is affected, run the following command to obtain a\nlist of secret keys that you have on your secret keyring:\n\ngpg --list-secret-keys\n\nThe output of this command includes both the size and type of the keys\nfound, and will look similar to this example:\n\n/home/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg\n----------------------------------------------------\nsec  1024D/01234567 2000-10-17 Example User <example@example.com>\nuid                            Example User <example@example.com>\n\nThe key length, type, and ID are listed together, separated by a forward\nslash.  In the example output above, the key's type is \"D\" (DSA, sign\nand encrypt).  Your key is unsafe if and only if the key type is \"G\"\n(ElGamal, sign and encrypt).  In the above example, the secret key is safe\nto use, while the secret key in the following example is not:\n\n/home/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg\n----------------------------------------------------\nsec  1024G/01234567 2000-10-17 Example User <example@example.com>\nuid                            Example User <example@example.com>\n\nFor more details regarding this issue, as well as instructions on how to\nrevoke any keys that are unsafe, refer to the advisory available from the\nGnuPG web site:\n\nhttp://www.gnupg.org/",
