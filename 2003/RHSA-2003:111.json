It is possible that a\nhostile IMAP server could cause arbitrary code to be executed by the user\nrunning Balsa.\n\nAdditionally, a buffer overflow in libesmtp (an SMTP library used by Balsa)\nbefore version 0.8.11 allows a hostile remote SMTP server to execute\narbitrary code via a certain response or cause a denial of service via long\nserver responses.\n\nUsers of Balsa are recommended to upgrade to these erratum packages which\ninclude updated versions of Balsa and libesmtp which are not vulnerable to\nthese issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank CORE security for discovering the\nvulnerability, and the Mutt team for providing a patch.",
