				"text": "mgetty is a getty replacement for use with data and fax modems.\n\nmgetty can be configured to run an external program to decide whether or\nnot to answer an incoming call based on Caller ID information.  Unpatched\nversions of mgetty prior to 1.1.29 would overflow an internal buffer if the\ncaller name reported by the modem was too long.\n\nAdditionally, the faxspool script supplied with versions of mgetty prior to\n1.1.29 used a simple permissions scheme to allow or deny fax transmission\nprivileges.  This scheme was easily circumvented because the spooling\ndirectory used for outgoing faxes was world-writable.\n\nAll users of mgetty should upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain mgetty 1.1.30 and are not vulnerable to these issues.",
