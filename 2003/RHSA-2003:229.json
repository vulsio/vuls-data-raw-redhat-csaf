				"text": "The ypserv package contains the Network Information Service (NIS) server.\n\nFor ypserv versions before 2.5 it was discovered that a memory leak which\ncan be triggered remotely. When someone requests a map that does not exist,\na previous mapname may be returned. This happens, for instance, if the\ncommand \"ypmatch foo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\" is run. Repeatedly running this\ncommand will result in the NIS server using more memory and running more\nslowly. This condition can lead to the killing of the ypserv process due to\nthe system being out of memory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1232 to this issue.\n\nFor ypserv version 2.7 and before, a malicious client can block NIS\nrequests. To do this, the malicious client queries ypserv via TCP and then\nignores the server's response. The ypserv daemon will then wait\nindefinitely for a response from the client indicating it received the\nmessage. During this time no other client requests are answered by ypserv,\ncausing a DoS. Versions 2.7 and greater of ypserv have been altered to fork\na child process for each client request -- thus preventing any one request\nfrom causing a DoS. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0251 to this issue.\n\nRed Hat recommends that users of NIS immediately upgrade to the packages\ncontained within this erratum, which are not vulnerable to these",
