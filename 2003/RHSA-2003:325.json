				"text": "The glibc packages contain GNU libc, which provides standard system libraries.\n\nA bug in the getgrouplist function can cause a buffer overflow if\nthe size of the group list is too small to hold all the user's groups.\nThis overflow can cause segmentation faults in user applications, which may\nhave security implications, depending on the application in question. This\nvulnerability exists only when an administrator has placed a user in a\nnumber of groups larger than that expected by an application. Therefore,\nthere is no risk in instances where users are members of few groups. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0689 to this issue.\n\nHerbert Xu reported that various applications can accept spoofed messages\nsent on the kernel netlink interface by other users on the local machine.\nThis could lead to a local denial of service attack.  In Red Hat Linux 9\nand later, the glibc function getifaddrs uses netlink and could therefore\nbe vulnerable to this issue.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0859 to this issue.\n\nIn addition to the security issues, a number of other bugs were fixed.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\npatch that checks that netlink messages actually came from the kernel, a\nbackported security patch for the getgroups list vulnerability, and patches\nfor the various bug fixes.\n\n[Update 2003-11-13]: The packages for Red Hat Linux 9 have been updated\nfor compatibility with kernels not provided by Red Hat.",
