The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0247 to this issue.\n\nAndrea Arcangeli found an issue in the low-level mxcsr code in which a\nmalformed address would leave garbage in cpu state registers. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nname CAN-2003-0248 to this issue.\n\nThe TCP/IP fragment reassembly handling allows remote attackers to cause a\ndenial of service (CPU consumption) via packets that cause a large number\nof hash table collisions, a vulnerability similar to CAN-2003-0244. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0364 to this issue.\n\nThese kernels also contain updated fixes for the ioperm security issue, as\nwell as fixes for a number of bugs.\n\nIt is recommended that users upgrade to these erratum kernels, which\ncontain patches to correct these vulnerabilities.",
