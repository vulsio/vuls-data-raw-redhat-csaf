During an audit of the CVS sources, Stefan Esser discovered\nan exploitable double-free bug in the CVS server.\n\nOn servers which are configured to allow anonymous read-only access, this\nbug could be used by anonymous users to gain write privileges.  Users with\nCVS write privileges can then use the Update-prog and Checkin-prog features\nto execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n\nAll users of CVS are advised to upgrade to these packages which\ncontain patches to correct the double-free bug.\n\nOur thanks go to Stefan Esser of e-matters for reporting this issue to us.",
