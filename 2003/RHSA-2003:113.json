				"text": "mod_auth_any is a Web server module that allows the Apache httpd server to\ncall arbitrary external programs to verify user passwords.\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the way mod_auth_any escapes shell\narguments when calling external programs. Versions of mod_auth_any included\nin Red Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3 are affected.  These vulnerabilities\nallow remote attackers to run arbitrary commands as the user under which\nthe Web server is running.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0084 to these issues.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which address\nthese vulnerabilities by changing the method by which external programs are\ninvoked.\n\nNote: This updated module is more careful in checking the results of the\nAuthAnyUserProg. Previous versions did not distinguish between the program\noutputting nothing due to success or a crash.  This replacement version\ntreats a zero-length result as if it were an \"Authentication Error,\" and\nexpects the program to output a valid username on success.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Daniel Jarboe and Maneesh Sahani for bringing\nthese issues to our attention.",
