This flaw allows an attacker to force commands to be executed by\na print spooler by submitting a malicious print job. Note that using the\n-dSAFER option is not sufficient to prevent command execution.\n\nUsers of Ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich are not vulnerable to this issue.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
