It can be used to tunnel an\nunencrypted network connection over an encrypted connection (encrypted\nusing SSL or TLS) or to provide an encrypted means of connecting to\nservices that do not natively support encryption.\n\nA previous advisory provided updated packages to address re-entrancy\nproblems in stunnel's signal-handling routines.  These updates did not\naddress other bugs that were found by Steve Grubb, and introduced an\nadditional bug, which was fixed in stunnel 3.26.\n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which address these\nissues by updating stunnel to version 3.26.\n\nNOTE: After upgrading, any instances of stunnel configured to run in daemon\nmode should be restarted, and any active network connections that are\ncurrently being serviced by stunnel should be terminated and reestablished.",
