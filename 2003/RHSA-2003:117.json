				"text": "Stronghold 3 contains a number of open source technologies including\nOpenSSL.  Two issues in OpenSSL have recently been discovered:\n\nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and open source toolkit that\nimplements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS v1) protocols.  It also implements a full-strength general \npurpose cryptography library.\n\nResearchers have discovered a timing attack on RSA keys. Applications\nmaking use of OpenSSL are generally vulnerable to such an attack, unless\nRSA blinding has been turned on. OpenSSL does not use RSA blinding by\ndefault and most applications do not enable RSA blinding. \n\nA local or remote attacker could use this attack to obtain the server's\nprivate key.  This could be done by determining factors using timing\ndifferences on:\n\n(1) The number of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction\n\n(2) The use of different integer multiplication algorithms (\"Karatsuba\" and\nnormal)\n\nIn order for an attack to be successful, an attacker must have good\nnetwork conditions that allow small changes in timing to be reliably\nobserved.\n\nAdditionally, the SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL allow remote attackers\nto perform an unauthorized RSA private key operation via a modified\nBleichenbacher attack. This attack uses a large number of SSL or TLS\nconnections, using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, and causes OpenSSL to leak\ninformation regarding the relationship between ciphertext and the\nassociated plaintext.  This is also known as the \"Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack.\"\n\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL group that\nenables RSA blinding by default and protects against\nKlima-Pokorny-Rosa attacks.",
