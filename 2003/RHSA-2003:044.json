Two cross-site scripting\n(XSS) issues have been found in w3m.\n\nAn XSS vulnerability in w3m 0.3.2 allows remote attackers to insert\narbitrary HTML and web script into frames.  Frames are disabled by default\nin the version of w3m shipped with Red Hat Linux.  Therefore, this problem\nwill not appear as long as users do not use w3m with the -F option, or\nenable frame support in either the /etc/w3m/w3mconfig or ~/.w3m/config\nconfiguration files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1335 to this issue.\n\nAn XSS vulnerability in versions of w3m before 0.3.2.2 allows attackers to\ninsert arbitrary HTML and web script into image attributes.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-1348 to this issue\n\nUsers of w3m under Red Hat Linux versions 7.0J, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 are\nadvised to upgrade to the updated packages containing w3m 0.3.1 with\na patch to correct these issues.",
