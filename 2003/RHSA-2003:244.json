This is triggered\nif optional renegotiation is used (SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate) along with\nverification of client certificates and a change to the cipher suite over\nthe renegotiation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0192 to this issue.\n\nApache does not filter terminal escape sequences from its error logs, which\ncould make it easier for attackers to insert those sequences into terminal\nemulators containing vulnerabilities related to escape sequences.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0020 to this issue.\n\nIt is possible to get Apache 1.3 to get into an infinite loop handling\ninternal redirects and nested subrequests. A patch for this issue adds a\nnew LimitInternalRecursion directive.\n\nAll users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the\napplicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting\nthese issues.\n\nAfter the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running\nthe following command:\n\n/sbin/service httpd restart",
