				"text": "The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nSeveral security issues have been found that affect the Linux kernel:\n\nAl Viro found a security issue in the tty layer whereby any user could\ncause a kernel oops.   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0247 to this issue.\n\nAndrea Arcangeli found an issue in the low-level mxcsr code in which a\nmalformed address would leave garbage in cpu state registers. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0248 to this issue.\n\nThe TCP/IP fragment reassembly handling allows remote attackers to cause\na denial of service (CPU consumption) via packets that cause a large number\nof hash table collisions, a vulnerability similar to CAN-2003-0244.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0364 to this issue.\n\nIt is recommended that users upgrade to these erratum kernels, which\ncontain patches to correct these vulnerabilities.  In addition, these\nkernels fix a number of bugs:\n\nDriver bugs fixes are included for the Silicon Image IDE driver, the USB\nohci driver, the Audigy driver, and the driver for the Olympus Camedia\ndigital camera.\n\nA fix written by Andrew Morton is included to address a system stall caused\nby file I/O in rare cases.\n\nAn updated fix corrects some bugs in the ptrace security fix for Red Hat\nLinux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0.  Note that these bugs were functionality\nlimitations, not additional security vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdated fixes for the ioperm security issue are also included.\n\nA potential data corruption scenario has been identified. This\nscenario can occur under heavy, complex I/O loads.  The scenario\nonly occurs while performing memory mapped file I/O, where the\nfile is simultaneously unlinked and the corresponding file blocks\nreallocated. Furthermore, the memory mapped writes must be to a\npartial page at the end of a file on an ext3 file system. As such,\nRed Hat considers this an unlikely scenario.\n\nRed Hat Linux kernel erratum RHSA-2003:172 exposed a bug in the quota\npackages for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3; a fixed quota package is also\nincluded in this erratum.",
