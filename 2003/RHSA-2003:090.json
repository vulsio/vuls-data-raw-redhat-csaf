				"text": "The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by\nmultiple programs on the system.  Sun RPC is a remote procedure call\nframework which allows clients to invoke procedures in a server process\nover a network.  XDR is a mechanism for encoding data structures for use\nwith RPC.  NFS, NIS, and many other network services are built upon Sun\nRPC.  The XDR encoder/decoder provided with glibc, derived from Sun's RPC\nimplementation, was demonstrated to be vulnerable to an integer overflow.\n\nAn integer overflow is present in the xdrmem_getbytes() function of glibc\n2.3.1 and earlier.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability\ncould cause buffer overflows and may be exploitable, leading to arbitrary\ncode execution.  \n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain patches to\nthe glibc libraries and, therefore, are not vulnerable to these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank eEye Digital Security for alerting us to this\nissue.",
