This causes the program to fail to change the\nownership and permissions of already opened entries.\n\nCAN-2003-0550: The STP protocol is known to have no security, which could\nallow attackers to alter the bridge topology. STP is now turned off by\ndefault.\n\nCAN-2003-0551: STP input processing was lax in its length checking, which\ncould lead to a denial of service (DoS).\n\nCAN-2003-0552: Jerry Kreuscher discovered that the Forwarding table could\nbe spoofed by sending forged packets with bogus source addresses the same\nas the local host.\n\nCAN-2003-0619: An integer signedness error in the decode_fh function of\nnfs3xdr.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel\npanic) via a negative size value within XDR data of an NFSv3 procedure call.\n\nCAN-2003-0699: The C-Media PCI sound driver in Linux kernel versions prior\nto 2.4.21 accesses userspace without using the get_user function, which is\na potential security hole.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security patches correcting these vulnerabilities.",
