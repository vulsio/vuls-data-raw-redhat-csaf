				"text": "The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nA ptrace-related vulnerability has been discovered that could allow a local\nuser to gain elevated (root) privileges without authorization.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0127 to this issue.\n\nA flaw has been discovered that could potentially lead to data corruption.\n The scenario only occurs while performing memory mapped file I/O, where\nthe file is simultaneously unlinked and the corresponding file blocks\nreallocated.  Furthermore, the memory mapped must be to a partial page at\nthe end of a file on an ext3 file system.  As such, Red Hat considers this\nscenario unlikely.\n\nA flaw has been found in several hash table implementations in the kernel\nnetworking code. A remote attacker could send packets with carefully\nchosen, forged source addresses in such a way as to make every routing\ncache entry get hashed into the same hash chain. The result would be that\nthe kernel would use a disproportionate amount of processor time to deal\nwith new packets, resulting in a remote denial of service attack. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0244 to this issue.\n\nIn addition, the following drivers have been updated to the version indicated:\n\n- e1000: 4.4.19-k1\n- e100: 2.1.29-k2\n- ips: 6.00.26\n- qla2100, qla2200, qla2300: v6.04.01\n- tg3 driver to 1.4c\n- cciss driver to 2.4.44\n- mpt fusion: 2.05.00\n- aic7xxx to 6.2.32\n- aic79xx to 1.3.6\n\nIf the system is configured to use alternate drivers, we recommend applying\nthe kudzu errata RHEA-2003:132 prior to updating the kernel.\n\nThe updated kernel also adds support for the IBM x450 platform and the\nMadison processor, and incorporates improved support for the hugetlb file\nsystem.  This file system makes efficient use of the large page size\nsupport that the Itanium architecture provides.   \n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which address these issues.",
