A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted email message\nwhich, when processed by sendmail, causes arbitrary code to be\nexecuted as root.\n\nWe are advised that a proof-of-concept exploit is known to exist, but\nis not believed to be in the wild.\n\nSince this is a message-based vulnerability, MTAs other than Sendmail\nmay pass on the carefully crafted message.  This means that unpatched\nversions of Sendmail inside a network could still be at risk even if\nthey do not accept external connections directly.\n\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain\na backported patch to correct this vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Eric Allman for his assistance with this\nvulnerability.",
