				"text": "XFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System, which provides the\ngraphical user interface, video drivers, etc. for Linux systems.\n\nA number of security vulnerabilities have been found and fixed.  In\naddition, various other bug fixes, driver updates, and other enhancements\nhave been made.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\nXterm, provided as part of the XFree86 packages, provides an escape\nsequence for reporting the current window title. This escape sequence\nessentially takes the current title and places it directly on the command\nline. An attacker can craft an escape sequence that sets the victim's Xterm\nwindow title to an arbitrary command, and then reports it to the command\nline. Since it is not possible to embed a carriage return into the window\ntitle, the attacker would then have to convince the victim to press Enter\nfor the shell to process the title as a command, although the attacker\ncould craft other escape sequences that might convince the victim to do so.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0063 to this issue.\n\nIt is possible to lock up versions of Xterm by sending an invalid DEC\nUDK escape sequence. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0071 to this issue.\n\nThe xdm display manager, with the authComplain variable set to false,\nallows arbitrary attackers to connect to the X server if the xdm auth\ndirectory does not exist. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1510 to this issue.\n\nThese erratum packages also contain an updated fix for CAN-2002-0164, a\nvulnerability in the MIT-SHM extension of the X server that allows local\nusers to read and write arbitrary shared memory. The original fix did not\ncover the case where the X server is started from xdm.\n\nThe X server was setting the /dev/dri directory permissions incorrectly,\nwhich resulted in the directory being world writable. It now sets the\ndirectory permissions to a safe value.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2001-1409 to\nthis issue.\n\nDriver updates and other fixes:\n\nThe Rage 128 video driver (r128) has been updated to provide 2D support\nfor all previously unsupported ATI Rage 128 hardware. DRI 3D support\nshould also work on the majority of Rage 128 hardware.\n\nBad page size assumptions in the ATI Radeon video driver (radeon) have\nbeen fixed, allowing the driver to work properly on ia64 and other\narchitectures where the page size is not fixed.\n\nA long-standing XFree86 bug has been fixed. This bug occurs when any form\nof system clock skew (such as NTP clock synchronization, APM suspend/resume\ncycling on laptops, daylight savings time changeover, or even manually\nsetting the system clock forward or backward) could result in odd\napplication behavior, mouse and keyboard lockups, or even an X server hang\nor crash.\n\nThe S3 Savage driver (savage) has been updated to the upstream author's\nlatest version \"1.1.27t\", which should fix numerous bugs reported by\nvarious users, as well as adding support for some newer savage hardware.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nXFree86 version 4.1.0 with patches correcting these issues.",
