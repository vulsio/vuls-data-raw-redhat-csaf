The\naddress parser performs insufficient bounds checking in certain conditions\ndue to a char to int conversion, making it possible for an attacker to\ntake control of the application.  Although no exploit currently exists,\nthis issue is probably locally exploitable and may be remotely exploitable.\n\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages containing a\nbackported patch which corrects these vulnerabilities.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Michal Zalewski for finding and reporting this\nissue.",
