During an audit of the CVS sources, Stefan Esser\ndiscovered an exploitable double-free bug in the CVS server.\n\nOn servers which are configured to allow anonymous read-only access, this\nbug could be used by anonymous users to gain write privileges.  Users with\nCVS write privileges can then use the Update-prog and Checkin-prog features\nto execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n\nAll users of CVS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which\ncontain patches to correct the double-free bug.\n\nOur thanks go to Stefan Esser of e-matters for reporting this issue to us.",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
