An active attacker may be able to use timing observations\nto distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and\nMAC verification errors.  Over multiple connections this can leak\nsufficient information to be able to retrieve the plaintext of a common,\nfixed block.\n\nIn order for an attack to be sucessful an attacker must be able to act as a\nman-in-the-middle to intercept and modify multiple connections which all\ninvolve a common fixed plaintext block (such as a password), and have good\nnetwork conditions that allow small changes in timing to be reliably observed.\n\nThese updated packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL group that\ncorrects this vulnerability.\n\nBecause server applications are affected by these vulnerabilities, we\nadvise users to restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality or\nalternatively reboot their systems after installing these updates.",
