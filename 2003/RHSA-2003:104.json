				"text": "Stronghold 3.0 contains a number of open source technologies such as\nOpenSSL, Apache, and PHP. The following paragraphs describe a number of\nissues that have been found in versions of these projects.\n\nIn a paper, Brice Canvel, Alain Hiltgen, Serge Vaudenay, and Martin\nVuagnoux describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC ciphersuites\nin SSL and TLS. An active attacker may be able to use timing observations\nto distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and\nMAC verification errors. Over multiple connections this can leak\nsufficient information to be able to retrieve the plain text of a common,\nfixed block. In order for an attack to be successful an attacker must be\nable to act as a man-in-the-middle to intercept and modify multiple\nconnections which all involve a common fixed plain text block (such as a\npassword), and have good network conditions that allow small changes in\ntiming to be reliably observed.\n\nThe SSL timing attack announced recently by David Brumly and Dan Boneh\nis not fixed by this erratum; this new issue will be addressed by a\nfuture erratum release.\n\nThe Apache Web server does not prevent escape sequences from being written\nto log files. This could allow an attacker to embed arbitrary escape\nsequences into log files. A recent paper by HD Moore highlighted\nseveral issues where common terminal emulator software (such as xterm) can\nbe remotely abused or exploited by displaying arbitrary escape sequences.\n\nThe MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) used in the PHP MySQL extension\nin PHP versions earlier than 4.3.0 does not properly verify length fields\nfor certain responses in the read_rows or read_one_row routines, which\nallows a malicious server to cause a denial of service and possibly execute\narbitrary code.\n\nStronghold 3.0 contains OpenSSL 0.9.6b, Apache 1.3.22, and PHP\n4.1.2 and is, therefore, vulnerable to these issues. Users of Stronghold are\nadvised to update to the errata versions of Stronghold 3.0 which contain\nbackported security fixes and are not vulnerable to these issues.",
