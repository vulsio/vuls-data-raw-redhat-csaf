				"category": "general",
				"text": "The pam_xauth module is used to forward xauth information from user to user\nin applications such as 'su'.\n\nAndreas Beck discovered that versions of pam_xauth supplied with Red Hat\nLinux since version 7.1 would forward authorization information from the\nroot account to unprivileged users. This could be used by a local attacker\nto gain access to an administrator's X session. In order to exploit this\nvulnerability, the attacker would have to get the administrator, as root,\nto use su to the account belonging to the attacker.\n\nUsers of pam_xauth are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain a patch that adds ACL (access control list) functionality to\npam_xauth and disallows root forwarding by default.\n\nVersions of pam_xauth included in Red Hat Linux 7 and earlier disabled\npassing of credentials from the root account to unprivileged users by\ndefault and are not affected by this issue.\n\nThanks to Andreas Beck for reporting this issue.",
