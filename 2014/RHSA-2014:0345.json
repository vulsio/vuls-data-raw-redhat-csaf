A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting\n(XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.\n(CVE-2013-4286)\n\nIt was found that Java Security Manager permissions configured via a policy\nfile were not properly applied, causing all deployed applications to be\ngranted the java.security.AllPermission permission. In certain cases, an\nattacker could use this flaw to circumvent expected security measures to\nperform actions which would otherwise be restricted. (CVE-2014-0093)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0093 issue was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss\nEAP Quality Engineering team.\n\nThis release serves as an update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform 6.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Documentation for\nthese changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 6.2.2 Release Notes, linked to in the References.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
