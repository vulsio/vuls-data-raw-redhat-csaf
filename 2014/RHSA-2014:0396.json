The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nImportant: This update is an emergency security fix being provided outside\nthe scope of the published support policy for Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization listed in the References section. In accordance with the\nsupport policy for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor 3.2 will not receive future security updates.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and\nDTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server\ncould send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a\nlimited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.\nNote that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include\nsensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original\nreporter.\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which corrects this issue.",
