				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform is a platform for Java applications,\nwhich integrates the JBoss Web Server with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nIt was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a\nspecially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for\ncommunication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt\nand modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)\n\nNote: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be\nusing a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL\nversion 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of\nOpenSSL. Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform includes OpenSSL 0.9.8e, so\nthis flaw is only exploitable when OpenSSL in JBoss EWP is used as a\nclient, communicating with a vulnerable server running OpenSSL version\n1.0.1 and above. For more information about this flaw, refer to:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter\nof this issue.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 as provided from\nthe Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The JBoss\nserver process must be restarted for this update to take effect.",
