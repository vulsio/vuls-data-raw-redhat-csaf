				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted\nenvironment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or\nbypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain services\nand applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide\nenvironment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue. (CVE-2014-6271)\n\nIt was found that the fix for CVE-2014-6271 was incomplete, and Bash still\nallowed certain characters to be injected into other environments via\nspecially crafted environment variables. An attacker could potentially use\nthis flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell\ncommands. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated\nattackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this\nissue. (CVE-2014-7169)\n\nA flaw was found in the way NSS parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)\ninput from certain RSA signatures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nforge RSA certificates by providing a specially crafted signature to an\napplication using NSS. (CVE-2014-1568)\n\nIt was discovered that the fixed-sized redir_stack could be forced to\noverflow in the Bash parser, resulting in memory corruption, and possibly\nleading to arbitrary code execution when evaluating untrusted input that\nwould not otherwise be run as code. (CVE-2014-7186)\n\nAn off-by-one error was discovered in the way Bash was handling deeply\nnested flow control constructs. Depending on the layout of the .bss\nsegment, this could allow arbitrary execution of code that would not\notherwise be executed by Bash. (CVE-2014-7187)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting CVE-2014-6271,\nand the Mozilla project for reporting CVE-2014-1568. Upstream acknowledges\nAntoine Delignat-Lavaud and Intel Product Security Incident Response Team\nas the original reporters of CVE-2014-1568. The CVE-2014-7186 and\nCVE-2014-7187 issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product\nSecurity.\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package.",
