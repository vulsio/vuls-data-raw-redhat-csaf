				"text": "Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the\nmanagement, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 serves as a replacement for Red\nHat JBoss BRMS 6.0.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the\nRed Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 Release Notes for information on the most\nsignificant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly\nat https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BRMS/\n\nThe following security issues are fixed with this release:\n\nIt was discovered that JBoss BRMS allowed remote authenticated users to\nsubmit arbitrary Java code in MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL) or JBoss\nRules expressions, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the\nsecurity context of the application server. Refer to the Solution section\nfor details on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2013-6468)\n\nIt was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML\ncontent, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass\nXML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,\nincluding remote code execution in the context of the server running the\nXStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)\n\nIt was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets\nto call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to\na Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code\nexecution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)\n\nIt was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)\nattacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external\nXML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing\nthe attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application\nserver. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB\n(Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2011-5245, CVE-2012-0818)\n\nIt was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when\ndecrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites\nwere used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain\ntext from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding\noracle. (CVE-2013-1624)\n\nIt was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in\nXML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker\nable to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read\nfiles accessible to the user running the application server and,\npotentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.\n(CVE-2014-0002)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of\nthe Red Hat Security Response Team, and the CVE-2013-6468 issue was\ndiscovered by Marc Schoenefeld of the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Grégory Draperi for independently reporting\nCVE-2013-6468.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1.",
