				"text": "JBoss Web Server is an enterprise ready web server designed for medium and\nlarge applications, and is based on Tomcat. JBoss Web Server provides\norganizations with a single deployment platform for Java Server Pages (JSP)\nand Java Servlet technologies, PHP, and CGI. It uses a genuine high\nperformance hybrid technology that incorporates the best of the most recent\nOS technologies for processing high volume data, while keeping all the\nreference Java specifications.\n\nApache Commons FileUpload package makes it easy to add robust,\nhigh-performance, file upload capability to servlets and web applications.\n\nIt was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in\nwhich at least one request contained either multiple content-length\nheaders, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding\nheader, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting\n(XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.\n(CVE-2013-4286)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload,\nwhich is embedded in the JBoss Web component of JBoss EAP bundled with\nJBoss BRMS and BPM Suite, handled small-sized buffers used by\nMultipartStream. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create a\nmalformed Content-Type header for a multipart request, causing JBoss Web to\nenter an infinite loop when processing such an incoming request.\n(CVE-2014-0050)\n\nAll users of the affected products as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to apply this update.",
