Refer to\nthe JBoss Operations Network 3.2.3 Release Notes for information on the\nmost significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was discovered that JBoss Web did not limit the length of chunk sizes\nwhen using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto perform a denial of service attack against JBoss Web by streaming an\nunlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server\nresources. (CVE-2014-0075)\n\nIt was found that JBoss Web did not check for overflowing values when\nparsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a JBoss Web server\nlocated behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header\ncorrectly. (CVE-2014-0099)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product\nSecurity.\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.3.",
