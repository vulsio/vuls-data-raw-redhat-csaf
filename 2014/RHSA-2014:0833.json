It is comprised of the Apache\nHTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector\n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat\nNative library.\n\nIt was discovered that Apache Tomcat did not limit the length of chunk\nsizes when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use\nthis flaw to perform a denial of service attack against Tomcat by streaming\nan unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server\nresources. (CVE-2014-0075)\n\nIt was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when\nparsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located\nbehind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly.\n(CVE-2014-0099)\n\nIt was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet\nimplementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External\nEntities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this\nto circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2014-0096)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product\nSecurity.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web\nServer process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
