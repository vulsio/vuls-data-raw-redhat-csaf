				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of\ncomponents for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache\nHTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector\n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat\nNative library.\n\nThis release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1,\nand includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0\nRelease Notes, linked to in the References section, for information on the\nmost significant of these changes.\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nA race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in\nthe mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page\nserved by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module\n(MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd\nchild process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the \"apache\" user. (CVE-2014-0226)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate module\nhandled request body decompression (configured via the \"DEFLATE\" input\nfilter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would be\ndecompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of system\nmemory and CPU on the target system. (CVE-2014-0118)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain DTLS\nServerHello requests. A specially crafted DTLS handshake packet could cause\na DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2014-0221)\n\nNote: This update provides a fix for the CVE-2014-0221 issue in openssl\npackages for Solaris and Microsoft Windows.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module\nexecuted CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.\nA remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause\nthe httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)\n\nIt was found that several application-provided XML files, such as web.xml,\ncontent.xml, *.tld, *.tagx, and *.jspx, resolved external entities,\npermitting XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker able to deploy\nmalicious applications to Tomcat could use this flaw to circumvent security\nrestrictions set by the JSM, and gain access to sensitive information on\nthe system. Note that this flaw only affected deployments in which Tomcat\nis running applications from untrusted sources, such as in a shared hosting\nenvironment. (CVE-2013-4590)\n\nIt was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a\nmalicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to\nprocess XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library\ndescriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML\nparser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities\nand/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications\ndeployed on the same Tomcat instance. (CVE-2014-0119)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting\nCVE-2014-0221. Upstream acknowledges Imre Rad of Search-Lab as the original\nreporter of this issue.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.",
