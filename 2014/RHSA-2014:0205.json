				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java\napplications based on JBoss Application Server 7.\n\nIt was found that the security audit functionality, as provided by Red Hat\nJBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6, logged request parameters in plain\ntext. This may have caused passwords to be included in the audit log files\nwhen using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local attacker with access\nto audit log files could possibly use this flaw to obtain application or\nserver authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058)\n\nThe provided patch to fix CVE-2014-0058 also allows greater control over\nwhich of the following components of web requests are captured in audit\nlogs:\n\n - parameters\n - cookies\n - headers\n - attributes\n\nIt is also possible to selectively mask some elements of headers,\nparameters, cookies, and attributes using masks. This capability is\nprovided by two system properties, which are introduced by this patch:\n\n1) org.jboss.security.web.audit\n\nDescription:\nThis property controls the granularity of the security auditing of web\nrequests.\n\nPossible values:\noff = Disables auditing of web requests\nheaders = Audits only the headers of web requests\ncookies = Audits only the cookies of web requests\nparameters = Audits only the parameters of web requests\nattributes = Audits only the attributes of web requests\nheaders,cookies,parameters = Audits the headers, cookies, and parameters of\nweb requests\nheaders,cookies = Audits the headers and cookies of web requests\n\nDefault Value:\nheaders, parameters\n\nExamples:\nSetting \"org.jboss.security.web.audit=off\" disables security auditing of\nweb requests entirely.\nSetting \"org.jboss.security.web.audit=headers\" enables security auditing of\nonly headers in web requests.\n\n2) org.jboss.security.web.audit.mask\n\nDescription:\nThis property can be used to specify a list of strings to be matched\nagainst headers, parameters, cookies, and attributes of web requests.\nAny element matching the specified masks will be excluded from security\naudit logging.\n\nPossible values:\nAny comma separated string indicating keys of headers, parameters, cookies,\nand attributes.\n\nDefault Value:\nj_password, authorization\n\nNote that currently the matching of the masks is fuzzy rather than strict.\nFor example, a mask of \"authorization\" will mask both the header called\nauthorization and the parameter called \"custom_authorization\". A future\nrelease may introduce strict masks.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.1 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
