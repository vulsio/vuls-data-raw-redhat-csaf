				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on\nInfinispan.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.3.0 serves as a replacement for\nRed Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.1. It includes various bug fixes and\nenhancements which are detailed in the Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.3.0\nRelease Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Data_Grid/\n\nThis update also fixes the following security issues:\n\nIt was discovered that JBoss Web did not limit the length of chunk sizes\nwhen using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto perform a denial of service attack against JBoss Web by streaming an\nunlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server\nresources. (CVE-2014-0075)\n\nIt was found that JBoss Web did not check for overflowing values when\nparsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a JBoss Web server\nlocated behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header\ncorrectly. (CVE-2014-0099)\n\nIt was found that the security audit functionality, provided by Red Hat\nJBoss Data Grid, logged request parameters in plain text. This may have\ncaused passwords to be included in the audit log files when using BASIC or\nFORM-based authentication. A local attacker with access to audit log files\ncould possibly use this flaw to obtain application or server authentication\ncredentials. Refer to the Solution section of this advisory for additional\ninformation on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2014-0058)\n\nIt was found that the security auditing functionality provided by PicketBox\nand JBossSX, both security frameworks for Java applications, used a\nworld-readable audit.log file to record sensitive information. A local user\ncould possibly use this flaw to gain access to the sensitive information in\nthe audit.log file. (CVE-2014-0059)\n\nIt was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet\nimplementation in JBoss Web allowed the definition of XML External Entities\n(XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this to\ncircumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2014-0096)\n\nIt was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a\nmalicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by JBoss Web to\nprocess XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library\ndescriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML\nparser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities\nand/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications\ndeployed on the same JBoss Web instance. (CVE-2014-0119)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product\nSecurity.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.3.0.",
