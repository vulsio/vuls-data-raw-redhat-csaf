				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java\napplications based on JBoss Application Server 7.\n\nApache CXF is an open source services framework, which is a part of\nRed Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.\n\nIt was found that the SecurityTokenService (STS), provided as a part of\nApache CXF, could under certain circumstances accept invalid SAML tokens as\nvalid. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted SAML token to gain\naccess to an application that uses STS for validation of SAML tokens.\n(CVE-2014-0034)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache CXF created error\nmessages for certain POST requests. A remote attacker could send a\nspecially crafted request which, when processed by an application using\nApache CXF, could consume an excessive amount of memory on the system,\npossibly triggering an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. (CVE-2014-0109)\n\nIt was found that when a large invalid SOAP message was processed by Apache\nCXF, it could be saved to a temporary file in the /tmp directory. A remote\nattacker could send a specially crafted SOAP message that, when processed\nby an application using Apache CXF, would use an excessive amount of disk\nspace, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0110)\n\nIt was found that the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS)\nimplementation enabled external entity expansion by default. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to view the contents of arbitrary files\naccessible to the application server user. (CVE-2014-3481)\n\nIt was discovered that UsernameTokens were sent in plain text by an Apache\nCXF client that used a Symmetric EncryptBeforeSigning password policy.\nA man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to obtain the user name\nand password used by the client application using Apache CXF.\n(CVE-2014-0035)\n\nThe CVE-2014-3481 issue was discovered by the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform QE team.\n\nThis release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 6.2.3, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.\nDocumentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat\nJBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.4 Release Notes, linked to in\nthe References.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
