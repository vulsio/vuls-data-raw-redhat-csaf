It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise\ncustomers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise\nMiddleware components that have been tested and certified together to\nprovide an integrated experience.\n\nIt was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML\ncontent, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass\nXML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,\nincluding remote code execution in the context of the server running the\nXStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)\n\nIt was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had\ninsufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.\nA remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language\nTransformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using\nXalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the\nsecure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the\nclasspath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the\ncontext of the application server running the application that uses\nXalan-Java.
