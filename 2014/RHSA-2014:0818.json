Refer to the\nRed Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.2 Release Notes for information on the most\nsignificant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly\nat https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BRMS/\n\nThe following security issues are fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had\ninsufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.\nA remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language\nTransformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using\nXalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the\nsecure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the\nclasspath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the\ncontext of the application server running the application that uses\nXalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)\n\nIt was found that the ServerTrustManager in the Smack XMPP API did not\nverify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains.\nA man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof servers and\nobtain sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0363)\n\nIt was found that the ParseRoster component in the Smack XMPP API did not\nverify the From attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to spoof IQ responses. (CVE-2014-0364)\n\nA flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could\nallow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a\nseries of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on\nthe server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2014-0193)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank James Roper of Typesafe for reporting the\nCVE-2014-0193 issue.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.2.",
