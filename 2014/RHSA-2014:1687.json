				"text": "OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify\nand deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking.\nIt can also be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn\nallows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and\napplications. Orchestration can also be integrated with Telemetry alarms to\nimplement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.\n\nIt was discovered that a user could temporarily be able to see the URL of a\nprovider template used in another tenant. If the template itself could be\naccessed, then additional information could be leaked that would otherwise\nnot be visible. (CVE-2014-3801)\n\nThe openstack-heat packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious version. The most notable enhancements are:\n\n* Added OS profiler support into Orchestration (heat).\n* Multiple environment files can now be specified on the command line.\n* The command 'resource-list' now displays 'physical_resource_id'.\n(BZ#1146092)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, Qpid would attempt to reconnect to a broken message\nbroker, even though multiple hosts were configured. With this update,\nreconnect() selects the next broker in the list for each connection\nattempt. (BZ#1082672)\n\n* Prior to this update, certain Qpid exceptions were not properly handled\nby the Qpid driver. As a result, the Qpid connection would fail and stop\nprocessing subsequent messages. With this update, all possible exceptions\nare handled to ensure the Qpid driver does not enter an unrecoverable\nfailure loop. Consequently, Orchestration (heat) will continue to process\nQpid messages, even after a major exception occur. (BZ#1085996)\n\n* The Qpid driver's v2 topology has been introduced to specifically address\nthe slow growth of orphaned direct exchanges over time. By default,\nhowever, services still used the original v1 topology of the Qpid driver.\nThe v2 topology had to be explicitly configured via the\n'qpid_topology_version = 2' parameter. With this fix, the Orchestration\nservice's distribution configuration file (/usr/share/heat/heat-dist.conf)\nnow contains the 'qpid_topology_version = 2' parameter. This effectively\nsets the Qpid driver's v2 topology as the default. In addition, the default\nvalue in the Qpid implementation has been changed to 2 as well.\n(BZ#1124137)\n\n* Previously, the version of Orchestration (heat) in Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux OpenStack Platform 4 did not include the \"host_routes\" property of\nthe OS::Neutron::Subnet resource that was added in later releases of\nOrchestration. This change adds support for this property, which allows\nhost routes to be specified for a subnet. (BZ#1095752)\n\nAll openstack-heat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues and add these enhancements.",
