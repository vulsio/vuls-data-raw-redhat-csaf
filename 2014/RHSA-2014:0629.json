				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nIt was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a\nspecially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for\ncommunication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt\nand modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)\n\nNote: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be\nusing a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL\nversion 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of\nOpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433\n\nA flaw was found in the way the handle_rx() function handled large network\npackets when mergeable buffers were disabled. A privileged guest user could\nuse this flaw to crash the host or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host,\nwhich could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with\nthe privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2014-0077)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting\nCVE-2014-0224. Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the\noriginal reporter of CVE-2014-0224. The CVE-2014-0077 issue was discovered\nby Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nvarious security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes\nincluded in this update address the following CVE numbers:\n\nCVE-2014-0015 and CVE-2014-0138 (curl issues)\n\nCVE-2014-2523 and CVE-2013-6383 (kernel issues)\n\nCVE-2014-0179 (libvirt issue)\n\nCVE-2010-5298, CVE-2014-0198, CVE-2014-0221, CVE-2014-0195, and\nCVE-2014-3470 (openssl issues)\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.",
