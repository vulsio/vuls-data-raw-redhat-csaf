				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,\nflexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.\nRed Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant\nmessaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.\n\nThis patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ\n6.1.0. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the\nreadme.txt file included with the patch files. The following security\nissues are addressed in this release:\n\nIt was discovered that Apache Shiro authenticated users without specifying\na user name or a password when used in conjunction with an LDAP back end\nthat allowed unauthenticated binds. (CVE-2014-0074)\n\nIt was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had\ninsufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.\nA remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language\nTransformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using\nXalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the\nsecure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the\nclasspath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the\ncontext of the application server running the application that uses\nXalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)\n\nIt was found that the SecurityTokenService (STS), provided as a part of\nApache CXF, could under certain circumstances accept invalid SAML tokens as\nvalid. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted SAML token to gain\naccess to an application that uses STS for validation of SAML tokens.\n(CVE-2014-0034)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache CXF created error\nmessages for certain POST requests. A remote attacker could send a\nspecially crafted request which, when processed by an application using\nApache CXF, could consume an excessive amount of memory on the system,\npossibly triggering an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. (CVE-2014-0109)\n\nIt was found that when a large invalid SOAP message was processed by Apache\nCXF, it could be saved to a temporary file in the /tmp directory. A remote\nattacker could send a specially crafted SOAP message that, when processed\nby an application using Apache CXF, would use an excessive amount of disk\nspace, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0110)\n\nIt was found that Jolokia was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery\n(CSRF) attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web\npage that, when visited by a user logged in to Jolokia, could allow the\nattacker to execute arbitrary methods on MBeans exposed via JMX.\n(CVE-2014-0168)\n\nIt was found that the Spring Framework did not, by default, disable the\nresolution of URI references in a DTD declaration when processing\nuser-provided XML documents. By observing differences in response times, an\nattacker could identify valid IP addresses on the internal network with\nfunctioning web servers. (CVE-2014-0225)\n\nIt was discovered that UsernameTokens were sent in plain text by an Apache\nCXF client that used a Symmetric EncryptBeforeSigning password policy.\nA man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to obtain the user name\nand password used by the client application using Apache CXF.\n(CVE-2014-0035)\n\nA flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could\nallow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a\nseries of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on\nthe server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2014-0193)\n\nRefer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for\ninstallation instructions.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank James Roper of Typesafe for reporting the\nCVE-2014-0193 issue.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this\nsecurity update.",
