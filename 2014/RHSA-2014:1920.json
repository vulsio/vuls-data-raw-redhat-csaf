				"category": "general",
				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of\ncomponents for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache\nHTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector\n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat\nNative library.\n\nThis update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value\n(TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade\nattacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS\nprotocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest\nsupported protocol version fails.\n\nThis can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.\nThe SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle\nattack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.\nThis issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias\nPOODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future\nupdate; it is recommended that users configure their applications to\nrequire at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.\n\nFor additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article\nat https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web\nServer process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
