				"text": "Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards-compliant\nmessaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.\n\nRed Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat\nJBoss A-MQ 6.0.0 and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to\nthe Release Notes document, available from the link in the References\nsection, for a list of changes.\n\nThe following security issues are resolved with this update:\n\nA flaw was found in the Apache Hadoop RPC protocol. A man-in-the-middle\nattacker could possibly use this flaw to unilaterally disable bidirectional\nauthentication between a client and a server, forcing a downgrade to simple\n(unidirectional) authentication. This flaw only affected users who have\nenabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features. (CVE-2013-2192)\n\nIt was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property\nfor disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks\non web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the\napplication server. The patch for this flaw disables external entity\nprocessing by default, and provides a configuration directive to re-enable\nit. (CVE-2013-4152)\n\nIt was found that the Spring MVC SourceHttpMessageConverter enabled entity\nresolution by default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct XXE\nattacks on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the\napplication server. The patch for this flaw disables external entity\nprocessing by default, and introduces a property to re-enable it.\n(CVE-2013-6429)\n\nThe Spring JavaScript escape method insufficiently escaped some characters.\nApplications using this method to escape user-supplied content, which would\nbe rendered in HTML5 documents, could be exposed to cross-site scripting\n(XSS) flaws. (CVE-2013-6430)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload\nhandled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a\nmultipart request, causing Apache Commons FileUpload to enter an infinite\nloop when processing such an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)\n\nIt was found that fixes for the CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-6429 XXE issues\nin Spring were incomplete. Spring MVC processed user-provided XML and\nneither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable\nthem, possibly allowing a remote attacker to conduct XXE attacks.\n(CVE-2014-0054)\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Spring Framework when\nusing Spring MVC. When the action was not specified in a Spring form, the\naction field would be populated with the requested URI, allowing an\nattacker to inject malicious content into the form. (CVE-2014-1904)\n\nThe HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name\nin /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom\nlibrary path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native\nlibraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI\nwrites them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way Apache Zookeeper stored\nthe password of an administrative user in the log files. A local user with\naccess to these log files could use the exposed sensitive information to\ngain administrative access to an application using Apache Zookeeper.\n(CVE-2014-0085)\n\nThe CVE-2013-6430 issue was discovered by Jon Passki of Coverity SRL and\nArun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team, the CVE-2013-2035\nissue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security\nTeam, and the CVE-2014-0085 issue was discovered by Graeme Colman of\nRed Hat.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to apply this update.",
