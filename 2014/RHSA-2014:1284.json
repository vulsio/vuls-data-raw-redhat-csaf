JBoss Data Virtualization makes data\nspread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML\nfiles, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local\ndatabase.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data\nVirtualization 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in\nthe README file included with the patch files.\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that Teiid SQL/XML permitted XML eXternal Entity (XXE)\nattacks. If a REST endpoint was deployed, a remote attacker could submit a\nrequest containing an external XML entity that, when resolved, allowed that\nattacker to read files on the application server in the context of the user\nrunning that server. (CVE-2014-0170)\n\nThis issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.",
