				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that\nprovides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss\nEnterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nThis JBoss Operations Network 3.3.0 release serves as a replacement for\nJBoss Operations Network 3.2.3, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to\nthe JBoss Operations Network 3.3.0 Release Notes for information on the\nmost significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5783 was incomplete: the code added\nto check that the server host name matches the domain name in a subject's\nCommon Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A\nman-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server\nusing a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)\n\nIt was found that the default context parameters as provided to RESTEasy\ndeployments by JBoss EAP did not explicitly disable external entity\nexpansion for RESTEasy. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform\nXML External Entity (XXE) attacks on RESTEasy applications accepting XML\ninput. (CVE-2014-3481)\n\nIt was found that the fix for CVE-2012-0818 was incomplete: external\nparameter entities were not disabled when the\nresteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false.\nA remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could\nuse this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application\nserver, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.\n(CVE-2014-3490)\n\nThe HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name\nin /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom\nlibrary path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native\nlibraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI\nwrites them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)\n\nIt was found that the security auditing functionality provided by PicketBox\nand JBossSX, both security frameworks for Java applications, used a\nworld-readable audit.log file to record sensitive information. A local user\ncould possibly use this flaw to gain access to the sensitive information in\nthe audit.log file. (CVE-2014-0059)\n\nThe CVE-2013-2035 and CVE-2012-6153 issues were discovered by Florian\nWeimer of Red Hat Product Security. The CVE-2014-3481 issue was discovered\nby the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform QE team. The\nCVE-2014-3490 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product\nSecurity.\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.3 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.3.0.",
