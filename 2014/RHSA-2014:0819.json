The Release Notes will be\navailable shortly at\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/\n\nThe following security issues are fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had\ninsufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features. A\nremote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language\nTransformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using\nXalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the\nsecure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the\nclasspath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the\ncontext of the application server running the application that uses\nXalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)\n\nIt was found that the ServerTrustManager in the Smack XMPP API did not\nverify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains. A\nman-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof servers and obtain\nsensitive information. (CVE-2014-0363)\n\nIt was found that the ParseRoster component in the Smack XMPP API did not\nverify the From attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to spoof IQ responses. (CVE-2014-0364)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.2.",
