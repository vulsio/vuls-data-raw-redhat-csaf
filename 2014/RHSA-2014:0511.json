A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the ClassLoader used by\nan application server running Struts 1. This could lead to remote code\nexecution under certain conditions. (CVE-2014-0114)\n\nIt was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in\nwhich at least one request contained either multiple content-length\nheaders, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding\nheader, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting\n(XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.\n(CVE-2013-4286)\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update.",
