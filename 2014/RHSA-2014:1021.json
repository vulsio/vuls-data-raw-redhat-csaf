				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java\napplications based on JBoss Application Server 7.\n\nA race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in\nthe mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page\nserved by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module\n(MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd\nchild process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the \"apache\" user. (CVE-2014-0226)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate module\nhandled request body decompression (configured via the \"DEFLATE\" input\nfilter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would be\ndecompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of system\nmemory and CPU on the target system. (CVE-2014-0118)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain DTLS\nServerHello requests. A specially crafted DTLS handshake packet could cause\na DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2014-0221)\n\nNote: This update provides a fix for the CVE-2014-0221 issue in openssl\npackages for Solaris, HP-UX, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module\nexecuted CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.\nA remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause\nthe httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)\n\nA flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could\nallow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a\nseries of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on\nthe server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2014-0193)\n\nIt was found that the isCallerInRole() method of the SimpleSecurityManager\ndid not correctly check caller roles. A remote, authenticated attacker\ncould use this flaw to circumvent the caller check in applications that use\nblack list access control based on caller roles. (CVE-2014-3472)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting\nCVE-2014-0221; upstream acknowledges Imre Rad of Search-Lab as the original\nreporter of this issue. Red Hat would also like to thank James Roper of\nTypesafe for reporting CVE-2014-0193, and CA Technologies for reporting\nCVE-2014-3472.\n\nThis release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform also includes bug\nfixes and enhancements. Documentation for these changes will be available\nshortly from the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.0 Release Notes,\nlinked to in the References.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
