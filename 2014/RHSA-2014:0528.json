It is comprised of the Apache\nHTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector\n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat\nNative library.\n\nIt was found that when Tomcat processed a series of HTTP requests in which\nat least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or\none content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat\nwould incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or\nobtain sensitive information from other requests. (CVE-2013-4286)\n\nIt was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a\ndenial of service flaw in the way Tomcat processed chunk extensions and\ntrailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could\nconsume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that\nchunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322)\n\nIt was found that previous fixes in Tomcat 6 to path parameter handling\nintroduced a regression that caused Tomcat to not properly disable URL\nrewriting to track session IDs when the disableURLRewriting option was\nenabled. A man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially use this flaw to\nhijack a user's session. (CVE-2014-0033)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload,\nwhich is embedded in Tomcat, handled small-sized buffers used by\nMultipartStream. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create a\nmalformed Content-Type header for a multipart request, causing Tomcat to\nenter an infinite loop when processing such an incoming request.\n(CVE-2014-0050)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web\nServer process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
