It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in\nthe README file included with the patch files.\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in\nwhich at least one request contained either multiple content-length\nheaders, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding\nheader, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting\n(XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.\n(CVE-2013-4286)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.",
