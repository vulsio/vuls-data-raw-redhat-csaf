Refer to the 2.6.0 Release\nNotes for information on the most significant of these changes, available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/\n\nThis release also fixes the following security issues:\n\nIt was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when\ndecrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites\nwere used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain\ntext from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding\noracle. (CVE-2013-1624)\n\nIt was found that Mojarra JavaServer Faces did not properly escape\nuser-supplied content in certain circumstances. Contents of outputText tags\nand raw EL expressions that immediately follow script or style elements\nwere not escaped. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL to\nexecute arbitrary web script in the user's browser. (CVE-2013-5855)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Framework\nKit 2.6.0.",
