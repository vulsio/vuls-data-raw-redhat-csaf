				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that\nprovides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss\nEnterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nThis JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 release serves as a replacement for\nJBoss Operations Network 3.2.1, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to\nthe JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 Release Notes for information on the\nmost significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the implementation of the\norg.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method\nprovided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files\naccessible to the user running the application server, and potentially\nperform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)\n\nIt was found that Mojarra JavaServer Faces did not properly escape\nuser-supplied content in certain circumstances. Contents of outputText tags\nand raw EL expressions that immediately follow script or style elements\nwere not escaped. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL to\nexecute arbitrary web script in the user's browser. (CVE-2013-5855)\n\nIt was found that the security audit functionality, provided by JBoss\nOperations Network, logged request parameters in plain text. This may have\ncaused passwords to be included in the audit log files when using BASIC or\nFORM-based authentication. A local attacker with access to audit log files\ncould possibly use this flaw to obtain application or server authentication\ncredentials. Refer to the Solution section of this advisory for additional\ninformation on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2014-0058)\n\nA flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could\nallow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a\nseries of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on\nthe server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0193)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Alexander Papadakis for reporting\nCVE-2014-3530, and James Roper of Typesafe for reporting CVE-2014-0193.\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2.",

					"details": "The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must\nlog in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your\nexisting JBoss Operations Network installation (including its databases,\napplications, configuration files, the JBoss Operations Network server's\nfile system directory, and so on).\n\nRefer to the JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 Release Notes for\ninstallation information.\n\nThe provided patch to fix CVE-2014-0058 also allows greater control over\nwhich of the following components of web requests are captured in audit\nlogs:\n\n- parameters\n- cookies\n- headers\n- attributes\n\nIt is also possible to selectively mask some elements of headers,\nparameters, cookies, and attributes using masks. This capability is\nprovided by two system properties, which are introduced by this patch:\n\n1) org.jboss.security.web.audit\n\nDescription:\nThis property controls the granularity of the security auditing of web\nrequests.\n\nPossible values:\noff = Disables auditing of web requests\nheaders = Audits only the headers of web requests\ncookies = Audits only the cookies of web requests\nparameters = Audits only the parameters of web requests\nattributes = Audits only the attributes of web requests\nheaders,cookies,parameters = Audits the headers, cookies, and parameters of\nweb requests\nheaders,cookies = Audits the headers and cookies of web requests\n\nDefault Value:\nheaders, parameters\n\nExamples:\nSetting \"org.jboss.security.web.audit=off\" disables security auditing of\nweb requests entirely.\nSetting \"org.jboss.security.web.audit=headers\" enables security auditing of\nonly headers in web requests.\n\n2) org.jboss.security.web.audit.mask\n\nDescription:\nThis property can be used to specify a list of strings to be matched\nagainst headers, parameters, cookies, and attributes of web requests.\nAny element matching the specified masks will be excluded from security\naudit logging.\n\nPossible values:\nAny comma separated string indicating keys of headers, parameters, cookies,\nand attributes.\n\nDefault Value:\nj_password, authorization\n\nNote that currently the matching of the masks is fuzzy rather than strict.\nFor example, a mask of \"authorization\" will mask both the header called\nauthorization and the parameter called \"custom_authorization\". A future\nrelease may introduce strict masks.",
