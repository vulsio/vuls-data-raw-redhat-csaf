				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,\nflexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\nA flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java\nvalidated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an\narbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the\nSignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an\nXML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)\n\nA flaw was found in the Apache Hadoop RPC protocol. A man-in-the-middle\nattacker could possibly use this flaw to unilaterally disable bidirectional\nauthentication between a client and a server, forcing a downgrade to simple\n(unidirectional) authentication. This flaw only affected users who have\nenabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features. (CVE-2013-2192)\n\nIt was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property\nfor disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks\non web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the\napplication server. (CVE-2013-4152)\n\nIt was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project\nallowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying\nTransforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)\n\nIt was found that the Spring MVC SourceHttpMessageConverter enabled entity\nresolution by default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct XXE\nattacks on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the\napplication server. (CVE-2013-6429)\n\nThe Spring JavaScript escape method insufficiently escaped some characters.\nApplications using this method to escape user-supplied content, which would\nbe rendered in HTML5 documents, could be exposed to cross-site scripting\n(XSS) flaws. (CVE-2013-6430)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload\nhandled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a\nmultipart request, causing Apache Commons FileUpload to enter an infinite\nloop when processing such an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)\n\nIt was found that fixes for the CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-6429 XXE issues\nin Spring were incomplete. Spring MVC processed user-provided XML and\nneither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable\nthem, possibly allowing a remote attacker to conduct XXE attacks.\n(CVE-2014-0054)\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Spring Framework when\nusing Spring MVC. When the action was not specified in a Spring form, the\naction field would be populated with the requested URI, allowing an\nattacker to inject malicious content into the form. (CVE-2014-1904)\n\nThe HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name\nin /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom\nlibrary path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native\nlibraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI\nwrites them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way Apache Zookeeper stored\nthe password of an administrative user in the log files. A local user with\naccess to these log files could use the exposed sensitive information to\ngain administrative access to an application using Apache Zookeeper.\n(CVE-2014-0085)\n\nThe CVE-2013-6430 issue was discovered by Jon Passki of Coverity SRL and\nArun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team, the CVE-2013-2035\nissue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security\nTeam, and the CVE-2014-0085 issue was discovered by Graeme Colman of\nRed Hat.",
