				"text": "The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.\n\nApache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.\n\nThis release provides an update to httpd, OpenSSL and Tomcat 6/7 for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2. The updates are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.2 Service Pack 2 serves as a update for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nUsers of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve several security issues\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that the httpd's mod_auth_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788)\n\n* A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12615)\n\n* A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12617)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way httpd handled invalid and previously unregistered HTTP methods specified in the Limit directive used in an .htaccess file. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the server memory, or cause httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2017-9798)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank OpenVPN for reporting CVE-2016-2183 and Hanno Böck for reporting CVE-2017-9798. Upstream acknowledges Karthikeyan Bhargavan (Inria) and Gaëtan Leurent (Inria) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2183.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Corruption in nodestatsmem in multiple core dumps but in different functions of each core dump. (BZ#1338640)\n\n* mod_cluster segfaults in process_info() due to wrongly generated assembler instruction movslq (BZ#1448709)\n\n* CRL checking of very large CRLs fails with OpenSSL 1.0.2 (BZ#1493075)\n\n* The jboss-ews-application-servers zip README contains incomplete description of fixed CVEs (BZ#1497953)",

Future updates may move them to MEDIUM or not enable them by default.\n\nNSS addressed this issue by implementing limits on the amount of plain text which can be encrypted by using the same key.

Servers using OpenSSL, should not disable AES-128 and AES-256 ciphersuites. Versions of Apache shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux use the default cipher string, in which AES is preferred over DES/3DES based ciphersuites.\n\nFor JBoss Middleware, and Java mitigations, please review this knowledge base article:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/2598471\n\nThis can be mitigated on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) by disabling the vulnerable TLS cipher suite in the applicable component.
