However, this was incorrect, as that issue only affected RPM installations and not zip files as provided by this erratum.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that a programming error in the processing of HTTPS requests in the Apache Tomcat servlet and JSP engine may result in denial of service via an infinite loop. (CVE-2017-6056)\n\n* It was found that GZIPInterceptor is enabled when not necessarily required in RESTEasy. An attacker could use this flaw to launch a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-6346)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Mikhail Egorov (Odin) for reporting the CVE-2016-6346 issue.",
