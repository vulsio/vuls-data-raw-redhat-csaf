				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 2 serves as an update for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that the httpd's mod_auth_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788)\n\n* It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function ap_some_auth_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using this API function could consequently allow access that should have been denied. (CVE-2015-3185)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank OpenVPN for reporting CVE-2016-2183. Upstream acknowledges Karthikeyan Bhargavan (Inria) and Gaëtan Leurent (Inria) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2183.",

Future updates may move them to MEDIUM or not enable them by default.\n\nNSS addressed this issue by implementing limits on the amount of plain text which can be encrypted by using the same key.

Servers using OpenSSL, should not disable AES-128 and AES-256 ciphersuites. Versions of Apache shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux use the default cipher string, in which AES is preferred over DES/3DES based ciphersuites.\n\nFor JBoss Middleware, and Java mitigations, please review this knowledge base article:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/2598471\n\nThis can be mitigated on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) by disabling the vulnerable TLS cipher suite in the applicable component.
