An attacker could use this flaw to assemble an object that could permit execution of arbitrary code if the server enabled Apache Solr's Config API. (CVE-2017-12629)\n\n* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)\n\n* The hotrod java client in infinispan automatically deserializes bytearray message contents in certain events. A malicious user could exploit this flaw by injecting a specially-crafted serialized object to attain remote code execution or conduct other attacks. (CVE-2016-0750)\n\nFor more information regarding CVE-2017-12629, see the article linked in the references section.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Sebastian Olsson (TrueSec) for reporting CVE-2016-0750.",

CVE-2019-17571 has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux via RHSA-2017:2423.\nAlso the rh-java-common-log4j package shipped with Red Hat Software Collections was addressed via RHSA-2017:1417\n\nIn Satellite 5.8, although the version of log4j as shipped in the nutch package is affected, nutch does not load any of the SocketServer classes from log4j. Satellite 5 is considered not vulnerable to this flaw since the affected code can not be reached.",

Customers may mitigate this issue by removing the SocketServer class outright; or if they must continue to use SocketAppenders, they can modify their SocketAppender configuration from SerializedLayout to use JsonLayout instead. An example of this in log4j-server.properties might look like this:\n\nlog4j.appender.file.layout=org.apache.log4j.JsonLayout",
