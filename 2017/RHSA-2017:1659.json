				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.\n\nThis release includes bug fixes as well as a new release of OpenSSL that addresses a number of outstanding security flaws. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)\n\n* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)\n\n* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections form other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)\n\n* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.",
