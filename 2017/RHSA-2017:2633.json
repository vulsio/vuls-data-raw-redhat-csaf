An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application.

A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page.

However the affected code is NOT used at this time:\n\nCandlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited BZ 1462702 , candlepin should not be affected.\n\nHowever as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked.\n\nJBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices. Some advise about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here: \n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231\n\nAlthough JBoss Fuse ships the vulnerable version of jackson-databind, it does not call on enableDefaultTyping() for any polymorphic deserialization operations which is the root cause of this vulnerability. We have raised a Jira tracker to ensure that jackson-databind will be upgraded for Fuse 7.0, however due to feasibility issues jackson-databind cannot be upgraded in JBoss Fuse 6.3.",
