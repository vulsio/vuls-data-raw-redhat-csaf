JBoss Data Virtualization makes data spread across physically distinct systems - such as multiple databases, XML files, and even Hadoop systems - appear as a set of tables in a local database.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3 Update 7 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3 Update 6, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. (CVE-2017-7525)\n\n* A vulnerability was discovered in Apache Thrift client libraries that allows remote, authenticated attackers to cause an infinite recursion via vectors involving the skip function; resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. (CVE-2015-3254)\n\n* A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in ZooKeeper which allows an attacker to dramatically increase CPU utilization by abusing \"wchp/wchc\" commands, leading to the server being unable to serve legitimate requests. (CVE-2017-5637)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525.",

However the affected code is NOT used at this time:\n\nCandlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited BZ 1462702 , candlepin should not be affected.\n\nHowever as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked.\n\nJBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices. Some advise about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here: \n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231\n\nAlthough JBoss Fuse ships the vulnerable version of jackson-databind, it does not call on enableDefaultTyping() for any polymorphic deserialization operations which is the root cause of this vulnerability. We have raised a Jira tracker to ensure that jackson-databind will be upgraded for Fuse 7.0, however due to feasibility issues jackson-databind cannot be upgraded in JBoss Fuse 6.3.",
