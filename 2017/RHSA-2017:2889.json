An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)\n\n* It was found that XStream contains a vulnerability that allows a maliciously crafted file to be parsed successfully which could cause an application crash. The crash occurs if the file that is being fed into XStream input stream contains an instances of the primitive type 'void'. An attacker could use this flaw to create a denial of service on the target system. (CVE-2017-7957)",
