A web page containing malicious content could cause an application\nusing kdelibs (such as Konqueror) to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n(CVE-2012-4512)\n\nA heap-based buffer over-read flaw was found in the way kdelibs calculated\ncanvas dimensions for large images. A web page containing malicious content\ncould cause an application using kdelibs to crash or disclose portions of\nits memory. (CVE-2012-4513)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The desktop must be restarted (log out,\nthen log back in) for this update to take effect.",
