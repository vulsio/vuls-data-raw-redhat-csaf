				"text": "JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the\nJava EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise\ncustomers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise\nMiddleware components that have been tested and certified together to\nprovide an integrated experience.\n\nThis JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 release serves as a\nreplacement for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP06. Refer to the\nJBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 Release Notes, available shortly\nfrom docs.redhat.com, for information on the most significant bug fixes\nincluded in this release.\n\nThe following security fixes are also included:\n\nJBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss Expression Language\n(EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing arbitrary Java methods\nto be executed. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary\ncode via a specially-crafted URL provided to certain applications based on\nthe JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly configured and enabled Java\nSecurity Manager would prevent exploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)\n\nNote: If you have created custom applications that are packaged with a copy\nof the JBoss Seam 2 library, those applications must be rebuilt with the\nupdated jboss-seam.jar file provided by this update.\n\nIt was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was\nsusceptible to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use\nthis flaw to cause JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time by\nsending an HTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map\nto the same hash value. This update introduces a limit on the number of\nparameters and headers processed per request to mitigate this issue. The\ndefault limit is 512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults\ncan be changed by setting the\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in\n\"server/$PROFILE/deploy/properties-service.xml\". (CVE-2011-4858)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way JBoss Web handled HTTP DIGEST\nauthentication. These flaws weakened the JBoss Web HTTP DIGEST\nauthentication implementation, subjecting it to some of the weaknesses of\nHTTP BASIC authentication, for example, allowing remote attackers to\nperform session replay attacks. (CVE-2011-1184, CVE-2011-5062,\nCVE-2011-5063, CVE-2011-5064)\n\nThe invoker servlets, deployed by default via httpha-invoker, only\nperformed access control on the HTTP GET and POST methods, allowing remote\nattackers to make unauthenticated requests by using different HTTP methods.\nDue to the second layer of authentication provided by a security\ninterceptor, this issue is not exploitable on default installations unless\nan administrator has misconfigured the security interceptor or disabled it.\n(CVE-2011-4085)\n\nA flaw was found in the way JBoss Web handled sendfile request attributes\nwhen using the HTTP APR (Apache Portable Runtime) or NIO (Non-Blocking I/O)\nconnector. A malicious web application running on a JBoss Web instance\ncould use this flaw to bypass security manager restrictions and gain access\nto files it would otherwise be unable to access, or possibly terminate the\nJava Virtual Machine (JVM). (CVE-2011-2526)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting\nCVE-2011-1484; oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4858; and the Apache Tomcat\nproject for reporting CVE-2011-2526. oCERT acknowledges Julian Wälde and\nAlexander Klink as the original reporters of CVE-2011-4858.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on\nJBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration\nfiles.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP06 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Portal\nPlatform 4.3 CP07.",
