				"text": "Part of the Native components for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is\nmod_cluster, an Apache HTTP Server (httpd) based load balancer. Like\nmod_jk, it uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to\nan application server node.\n\nIt was found that mod_cluster allowed worker nodes to register on any\nvirtual host (vhost), regardless of the security constraints applied to\nother vhosts. In a typical environment, there will be one vhost configured\ninternally for worker nodes, and another configured externally for serving\ncontent. A remote attacker could use this flaw to register an\nattacker-controlled worker node via an external vhost that is not\nconfigured to apply security constraints, then use that worker node to\nserve malicious content, intercept credentials, and hijack user sessions.\n(CVE-2011-4608)\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 as provided from\nthe Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. Refer to the\nSolution section for installation instructions.",
