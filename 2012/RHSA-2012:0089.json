				"text": "JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is a middleware management solution\nthat provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor\nJBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nThis JBoss ON 2.4.2 release serves as a replacement for JBoss ON 2.4.1,\nand includes several bug fixes. Refer to the JBoss ON 2.4.2 Release Notes\nfor information on the most significant of these changes. The Release\nNotes will be available shortly from\nhttps://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nJBoss ON did not properly verify security tokens, allowing an unapproved\nagent to connect as an approved agent. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to spoof the identity of an approved agent, allowing them to hijack\nthe approved agent's session and steal its security token. As a result,\nthe attacker could retrieve sensitive data about the server the hijacked\nagent was running on, including JMX credentials. (CVE-2012-0052)\n\nJBoss ON sometimes allowed agent registration to succeed when the\nregistration request did not include a security token. This is a feature\ndesigned to add convenience. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nspoof the identity of an approved agent and pass a null security token,\nallowing them to hijack the approved agent's session, and steal its\nsecurity token. As a result, the attacker could retrieve sensitive data\nabout the server the hijacked agent was running on, including JMX\ncredentials. (CVE-2012-0062)\n\nIt was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was\nsusceptible to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use\nthis flaw to cause JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time by\nsending an HTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map\nto the same hash value. This update introduces a limit on the number of\nparameters and headers processed per request to mitigate this issue. The\ndefault limit is 512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults\ncan be changed by setting the\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in\n\"server/$PROFILE/deploy/properties-service.xml\". (CVE-2011-4858)\n\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the JBoss ON\nadministration interface. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was\nlogged into the JBoss ON administration interface, into visiting a\nspecially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in\nthe context of the user's JBoss ON session. (CVE-2011-3206)\n\nJBoss ON did not verify that a user had the proper modify resource\npermissions when they attempted to delete a plug-in configuration update\nfrom the group connection properties history. This could allow such a user\nto delete a plug-in configuration update from the audit trail. Note that a\nuser without modify resource permissions cannot use this flaw to make\nconfiguration changes. (CVE-2011-4573)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4858. oCERT\nacknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of\nCVE-2011-4858.\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON\ninstallation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,\nand so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 2.4.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2.",
