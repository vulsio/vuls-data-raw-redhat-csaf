				"text": "JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the\nJava EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise\ncustomers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise\nMiddleware components that have been tested and certified together to\nprovide an integrated experience.\n\nThis release of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 serves as a\nreplacement for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.1, and includes bug\nfixes. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 Release Notes\nfor information on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes\nwill be available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote\nwrite access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the\nHAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to\naccess the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the\nHAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,\ndelete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,\napplication-specific impacts. (CVE-2011-4605)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the\nSYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a\nspecially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the\nApache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application\nhang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)\n\nIt was found that the JMX Console did not protect against Cross-Site\nRequest Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker could trick a user,\nwho was logged into the JMX Console, into visiting a specially-crafted URL,\nthe attacker could perform operations on MBeans, which may lead to\narbitrary code execution in the context of the JBoss server process.\n(CVE-2011-2908)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Apache POI, a Java API for manipulating files\ncreated with a Microsoft Office application, handled memory when processing\ncertain Channel Definition Format (CDF) and Compound File Binary Format\n(CFBF) documents. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted CDF\nor CFBF document to an application using Apache POI, leading to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2012-0213)\n\nWhen a JBoss server is configured to use JaccAuthorizationRealm, the\nWebPermissionMapping class creates permissions that are not checked and can\npermit access to users without checking their roles. If the\nignoreBaseDecision property is set to true on JBossWebRealm, the web\nauthorization process is handled exclusively by JBossAuthorizationEngine,\nwithout any input from JBoss Web. This allows any valid user to access an\napplication, without needing to be assigned the role specified in the\napplication's web.xml \"security-constraint\" tag. (CVE-2012-1167)\n\nWhen a JGroups channel is started, the JGroups diagnostics service would be\nenabled by default with no authentication. This service is exposed via IP\nmulticast. An attacker on an adjacent network could exploit this flaw to\nread diagnostics information. (CVE-2012-2377)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Christian Schlüter (VIADA) for reporting the\nCVE-2011-4605 issue.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on\nJBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration\nfiles, and any databases and database settings.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.1 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Portal\nPlatform 5.2.2.",
