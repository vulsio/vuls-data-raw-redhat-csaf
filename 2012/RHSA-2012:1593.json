JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for JBoss Enterprise SOA\nPlatform 5.3.0. It includes various bug fixes. The following security issue\nis also fixed with this release:\n\nA flaw was found in the way Apache CXF verified that XML elements were\nsigned or encrypted by a particular Supporting Token. Apache CXF checked to\nensure these elements were signed or encrypted by a Supporting Token, but\nnot whether the correct token was used. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to transmit confidential information without the appropriate security,\nand potentially circumvent access controls on web services exposed via\nApache CXF. (CVE-2012-2379)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting this\nissue.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.",
