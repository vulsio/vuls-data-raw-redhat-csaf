				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor5 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.\nIt includes everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A\nsubset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red\nHat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nIt was discovered that the formatted printing functionality in glibc did\nnot properly restrict the use of alloca(). This could allow an attacker to\nbypass FORTIFY_SOURCE protections and execute arbitrary code using a format\nstring flaw in an application, even though these protections are expected\nto limit the impact of such flaws to an application abort. (CVE-2012-3406)\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nvarious security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes\nincluded in this update address the following CVE numbers:\n\nCVE-2012-3817 (bind issue)\n\nCVE-2012-3571 (dhcp issue)\n\nCVE-2012-2313 (kernel issue)\n\nCVE-2012-0441 (nss issue)\n\nCVE-2012-2337 and CVE-2012-3440 (sudo issues)\n\nCVE-2012-2625 (xen issue)\n\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.",
