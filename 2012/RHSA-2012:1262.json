				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor5 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.\nIt includes everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A\nsubset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red\nHat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences\nwhen emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to\nwrite to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual\nconsole back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the\nhost or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,\nwere found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric\nrepresentation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used\nsuch a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the\napplication to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2012-3480)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting the CVE-2012-3515\nissue.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include various bug\nfixes, as well as a fix for CVE-2012-3515 in the xen package; however, for\nthis component, it had no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor itself.\n\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.",
