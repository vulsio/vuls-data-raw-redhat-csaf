If the LDAP bind account credentials became\ninvalid, subsequent log in attempts with any password for user accounts\ncreated via LDAP were successful. A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto log into LDAP-based JBoss ON accounts without knowing the correct\npasswords. (CVE-2012-1100)\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON\ninstallation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,\nthe JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to install this update.",
