JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality. OpenID4Java allows you to implement\nOpenID authentication in your Java applications. OpenID4Java is a\nTechnology Preview.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for JBoss Enterprise SOA\nPlatform 5.2.0. It includes various bug fixes. The following security issue\nis also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the Attribute Exchange (AX) extension of OpenID4Java was\nnot checking to ensure attributes were signed. If AX was being used to\nreceive information that an application only trusts the identity provider\nto assert, a remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct\nman-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the integrity of the information\nvia a specially-crafted request. By default, only the JBoss Seam openid\nexample application uses OpenID4Java. (CVE-2011-4314)\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.",
