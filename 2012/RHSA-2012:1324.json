				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor5 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the way socket buffers (skb) requiring TSO (TCP segment\noffloading) were handled by the sfc driver. If the skb did not fit within\nthe minimum-size of the transmission queue, the network card could\nrepeatedly reset itself. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2012-3412)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting\nthis issue.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nvarious security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes\nincluded in this update address the following CVE numbers:\n\nCVE-2012-4244 (bind issue)\n\nCVE-2012-2319, CVE-2012-3430, and CVE-2012-3510 (kernel issues)\n\nCVE-2011-3102, CVE-2012-0841, and CVE-2012-2807 (libxml2 issues)\n\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.",
