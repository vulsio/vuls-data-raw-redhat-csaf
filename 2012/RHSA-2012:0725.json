Refer to the JBoss ON 3.1.0\nRelease Notes for information on the most significant of these changes. The\nRelease Notes will be available shortly from\nhttps://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the\nSYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a\nspecially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the\nApache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application\nhang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON\ninstallation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,\nthe JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.1.0.",
