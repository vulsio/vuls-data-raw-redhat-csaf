Refer to the JBoss ON 3.1.1\nRelease Notes for information on the most significant of these changes. The\nRelease Notes will be available shortly from\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that JBoss Web did not handle large numbers of parameters and\nlarge parameter values efficiently. A remote attacker could make JBoss Web\nuse an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP request containing a\nlarge number of parameters or large parameter values. This update\nintroduces limits on the number of parameters and headers processed per\nrequest to address this issue. The default limit is 512 for parameters and\n128 for headers. These defaults can be changed by setting the\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in\n\"jbossas/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/properties-service.xml\". (CVE-2012-0022)\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON\ninstallation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,\nthe JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.1.1.",
