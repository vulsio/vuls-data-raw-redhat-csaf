OCP versions 3.9 and later should use the updated 'docker' and 'runc' packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.\n\nOCP versions 3.4 through 3.7 originally used 'docker' version 1.12 from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras channel. An updated version of 'docker' 1.12 has been delivered to the RPM channels for OCP versions 3.4 through 3.7.\n\nOCP version 3.9 previously shipped a version of 'runc' in it's RPM repository. OCP 3.9 clusters using CRI-O should update 'runc' from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras channel.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host 7 is not affected by this vulnerability as the target runc binaries are stored on a read-only filesystem and cannot be overwritten.",
