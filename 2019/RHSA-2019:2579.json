Create systemd service, and change command line parameters according to the environment\nwhere Ceph radosgw is running.\n\n~]# cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/ceph-rgw.service \n[Unit]\nDescription=Ceph RGW daemon\n\n[Service]\nType=forking\nExecStart=/bin/radosgw -n client.rgw.$(HOSTNAME REDACTED)\nRestart=on-abnormal\nRestartSec=1s\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n3. Run systemd service 'ceph-rgw.service'\n\nCaveat: It still takes +1-2 sec to get service back online. After applying above mentioned mitigation, the malicious IP can be blocked by a firewall rule if there are continuous attempts to launch remote denial of service. This mitigation is of limited use if the attack is launched from multiple IPs. It is recommended to limit the exposure of ceph RGW server to known clients.\n\nOR \n\nMitigation 2:\nuse 'civetweb' as HTTP frontend with ceph RGW.",
