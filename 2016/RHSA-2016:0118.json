Refer to\nthe Customer Portal page linked in the References section for information\non the most significant of these changes.\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code\nexecution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed\nchain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute\narbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the commons-\ncollections library. (CVE-2015-7501)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way applications using Groovy used the\nstandard Java serialization mechanism. A remote attacker could use a\nspecially crafted serialized object that would execute code directly\nwhen deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do\nnot isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this\nvulnerability. (CVE-2015-3253)\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.3.4 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.3.5.",
