It includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.2 Release Notes linked to in the References section for information about the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was found that the Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL) allowed the processing of untrusted XML documents to utilize external entity references, which could access resources on the host system and, potentially, allowing arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2015-0254)\n\n* It was reported that EAP 7 Application Server/Undertow web server is vulnerable to the injection of arbitrary HTTP headers, and also response splitting, due to insufficient sanitization and validation of user input before the input is used as part of an HTTP header value. (CVE-2016-4993)\n\n* The domain controller will not propagate its administrative RBAC configuration to some slaves. An attacker could use this to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-5406)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Calum Hutton (NCC Group) and Mikhail Egorov (Odin) for reporting CVE-2016-4993. The CVE-2016-5406 issue was discovered by Tomaz Cerar (Red Hat).",
