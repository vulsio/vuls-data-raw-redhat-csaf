It is comprised of the\nApache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat\nConnector(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and\nthe Tomcat Native library.\n\nA padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0\n(SSLv2) protocol. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to decrypt\nRSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol\nversion, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol\nattack is publicly referred to as DROWN. (CVE-2016-0800)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2\nhandshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\nTLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both\nthe SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)\n\nA flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate SSLv2\nciphers that were disabled on the server. This could result in weak\nSSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to\nman-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel as the original\nreporters of CVE-2016-0800 and CVE-2015-3197; and Sean Burford (Google)\nand Emilia Käsper (OpenSSL development team) as the original reporters of\nCVE-2015-0293.\n\nUsers of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 are advised to upgrade to these\nupdated packages which fix these issues. The Red Hat JBoss Web Server\nprocess must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
