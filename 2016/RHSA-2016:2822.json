A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2016-3674)\n\n* Drools Workbench contains the path traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability allows a remote, authenticated attacker to bypass the directory restrictions and retrieve arbitrary files from the affected host. (CVE-2016-7041)\n\n* JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 are vulnerable to a stored XSS via business process editor. The flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-5398. Remote, authenticated attackers that have privileges to create business processes can store scripts in them, which are not properly sanitized before showing to other users, including admins. (CVE-2016-8608)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Jonas Bauters (NVISO) for reporting CVE-2016-7041. The CVE-2016-8608 issue was discovered by Kirill Gaevskii (Red Hat).",
