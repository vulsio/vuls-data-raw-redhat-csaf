Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.9 Release Notes, linked to in the References. \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was found that JGroups did not require necessary headers for encrypt\nand auth protocols from new nodes joining the cluster. An attacker could\nuse this flaw to bypass security restrictions, and use this vulnerability\nto send and receive messages within the cluster, leading to information\ndisclosure, message spoofing, or further possible attacks. (CVE-2016-2141)\n\nMore information about this vulnerability is available at: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2360521\n\n* A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's and JBoss Web's\nRequestUtil.java. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to\nbypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory\nvia a '/..' in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource,\ngetResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call, as demonstrated by the\n$CATALINA_BASE/webapps directory. (CVE-2015-5174)\n\nThe CVE-2016-2141 issue was discovered by Dennis Reed (Red Hat).",
