A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service by sending a specially-crafted cross-origin HTTP request. (CVE-2016-9579)\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, the radosgw-all Upstart service depended on the ceph-all service in order to trigger a start operation. In some cases, ceph-all was not defined on Ceph Object Gateway nodes due to the packaging layout. As a consequence, radosgw-all did not start on boot unless the ceph package was also installed. With this update, radosgw-all has been modified to start according to runlevel in addition to the ceph-all event trigger. As a result, radosgw-all starts on boot also when the ceph package is not installed on a node. (BZ#1406047)",
