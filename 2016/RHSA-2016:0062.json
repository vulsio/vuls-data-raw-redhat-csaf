Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, \nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability \nfrom the CVE links in the References section.\n\n[Updated 15th February 2018]\nPreviously, this erratum stated that CVE-2012-1148 was fixed .This was incorrect;the erratum text has now been modified to reflect this.",

				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of \ncomponents for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache \nHTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector \n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat \nNative library.\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and\nresponses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use\nthese flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode \ndifferently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to \nHTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of hash arrays in \nExpat. An attacker could use this flaw to make an application using Expat \nconsume an excessive amount of CPU time by providing a specially-crafted\nXML file that triggers multiple hash function collisions. To mitigate this\nissue, randomization has been added to the hash function to reduce the\nchance of an attacker successfully causing intentional collisions.\n(CVE-2012-0876)\n\nA flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when \nprocessing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could use \nTrailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header processing was \nperformed by other modules. This could, for example, lead to a bypass of \nheader restrictions defined with mod_headers. (CVE-2013-5704)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat \nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web \nServer process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
