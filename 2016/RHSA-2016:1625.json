A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5387)\n\nNote: After this update, Apache HTTP Server will no longer pass the value of the Proxy request header to scripts via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.",
