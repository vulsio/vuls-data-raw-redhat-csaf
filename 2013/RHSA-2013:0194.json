Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nThis JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 release serves as a\nreplacement for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2, and includes\nbug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform 5.2.0 Release Notes for information on the most significant of\nthese changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/",

				"text": "An attack technique against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when block\nciphers were used in CBC mode could allow a remote attacker to conduct\nchosen-ciphertext attacks, leading to the recovery of the entire plain text\nof a particular cryptogram. (CVE-2011-1096)\n\nJBoss Web Services leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric\nkeys (for XML encryption), allowing a remote attacker to recover the entire\nplain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)\n\nSpring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)\nexpressions twice, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in\nthe context of the application server, or to obtain sensitive information\nfrom the server. Manual action is required to apply this fix. Refer to the\nSolution section. (CVE-2011-2730)\n\nApache CXF checked to ensure XML elements were signed or encrypted by a\nSupporting Token, but not whether the correct token was used. A remote\nattacker could transmit confidential information without the appropriate\nsecurity, and potentially circumvent access controls on web services\nexposed via Apache CXF. Refer to the Solution section for details.\n(CVE-2012-2379)\n\nWhen an application used FORM authentication, along with another component\nthat calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to\nFormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was\npossible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator\nby appending \"/j_security_check\" to the end of a URL. (CVE-2012-3546)\n\nThe JMX Console was vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing a remote attacker\nto hijack the authenticated JMX Console session of an administrator.\n(CVE-2011-2908)\n\nAn XSS flaw allowed a remote attacker to perform an XSS attack against\nvictims using the JMX Console. (CVE-2011-4575)\n\nSecurityAssociation.getCredential() returned the previous credential if\nno security context was provided. Depending on the deployed applications,\nthis could possibly allow a remote attacker to hijack the credentials of a\npreviously-authenticated user. (CVE-2012-3370)\n\nConfiguring the JMX Invoker to restrict access to users with specific\nroles did not actually restrict access, allowing remote attackers with\nvalid JMX Invoker credentials to perform JMX operations accessible to\nroles they are not a member of. (CVE-2012-5478)\n\ntwiddle.sh accepted credentials as command line arguments, allowing local\nusers to view them via a process listing. (CVE-2009-5066)\n\nThe JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow\nunauthenticated access by default in some profiles. The security\ninterceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation\nof this flaw. If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently\ndisabled, this flaw could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context\nof the user running the JBoss server. (CVE-2012-0874)\n\nThe JGroups diagnostics service was enabled with no authentication when a\nJGroups channel was started, allowing attackers on the adjacent network to\nread diagnostic information. (CVE-2012-2377)\n\nCallerIdentityLoginModule retained the password from the previous call if a\nnull password was provided. In non-default configurations this could\npossibly lead to a remote attacker hijacking a previously-authenticated\nuser's session. (CVE-2012-3369)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for\nreporting CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487; the Apache CXF project for\nreporting CVE-2012-2379; and Tyler Krpata for reporting CVE-2011-4575.\nCVE-2012-3370 and CVE-2012-3369 were discovered by Carlo de Wolf of Red\nHat; CVE-2012-5478 discovered by Derek Horton of Red Hat; CVE-2012-0874\ndiscovered by David Jorm of Red Hat; and CVE-2012-2377 was discovered by\nRed Hat.",
