				"text": "PackStack is a command line utility that uses Puppet modules to support\nrapid deployment of OpenStack on existing servers over an SSH connection.\nPackStack is suitable for deploying both single node proof of concept\ninstallations and more complex multi-node installations.\n\nIt was found that PackStack did not handle the answer file securely. In\nsome environments, such as those using a non-default umask, a local\nattacker could possibly modify the answer file if PackStack was run in an\nattacker controlled directory, or attempted to create the answer file in\n\"/tmp/\", allowing the attacker to modify systems being deployed using\nOpenStack. Note: After applying this update, PackStack will create the\nanswer file in the user's home directory by default. It will no longer\ncreate it in the current working directory or the \"/tmp/\" directory by\ndefault. (CVE-2013-1815)\n\nThe CVE-2013-1815 issue was discovered by Derek Higgins of the Red Hat\nOpenStack team.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs in the openstack-packstack package.\n\nAll users of openstack-packstack are advised to upgrade to this updated\npackage, which corrects these issues.",
