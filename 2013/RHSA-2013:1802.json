				"text": "The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nUpgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may\nappear with the status of \"Install Failed\". If this happens, place the host\ninto maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an\n\"Up\" state.\n\nA divide-by-zero flaw was found in the apic_get_tmcct() function in KVM's\nLocal Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC) implementation.\nA privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.\n(CVE-2013-6367)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting this\nissue.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nvarious security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes\nincluded in this update address the following CVE numbers:\n\nCVE-2013-2141, CVE-2013-4470, and CVE-2013-6368 (kernel issues)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* The NVR of the rhev-hypervisor6 rpm and the contents of\n/etc/system-release did not match. This caused the hypervisor to show an\nerror message \"A new version is available; an upgrade option will appear\nonce the Host is moved to maintenance mode.\" and suggested an update, even\nthough the hypervisor was up to date. The version information in the rpm\nNVR and /etc/system-release now match. Now, the hypervisor only suggests\nupdating when there is an update available. (BZ#1034817)\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.",
