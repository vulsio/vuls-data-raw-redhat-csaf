				"text": "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications\nbased on JBoss Application Server 7.\n\nThis release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform 6.0.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 6.1.0\nRelease Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,\navailable shortly from https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\nXML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various\nframeworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use\ninsecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled\non endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as\nCVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be\nrecovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)\n\nNote: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when\nWS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements. It is best\npractice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce security requirements.\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification\nin OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash\napplications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted\nresponse. (CVE-2013-0166)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting\nTLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites\nwere used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain\ntext from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a\npadding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)\n\nWhen applications running on JBoss Web used the COOKIE session tracking\nmethod, the org.apache.catalina.connector.Response.encodeURL() method\nreturned the URL with the jsessionid appended as a query string parameter\nwhen processing the first request of a session. An attacker could possibly\nexploit this flaw by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain a\nuser's jsessionid and hijack their session, or by extracting the jsessionid\nfrom log files. Note that no session tracking method is used by default,\none must be configured. (CVE-2012-4529)\n\nIf multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class\nname, and provided their own implementations of it, the first application\nto be loaded will have its implementation used for all other applications\nusing the same custom authorization module class name. A local attacker\ncould use this flaw to deploy a malicious application that provides\nimplementations of custom authorization modules that permit or deny user\naccess according to rules supplied by the attacker. (CVE-2012-4572)\n\nThe GUI installer created a world-readable auto-install XML file containing\nboth the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform administrator password and\nthe sucker password for the selected messaging system in plain text. A\nlocal user able to access the directory where the GUI installer was run\ncould use this flaw to gain administrative access to the JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform instance. (CVE-2013-0218)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj\nSomorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.\nCVE-2012-4572 was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP\nQuality Engineering team, and CVE-2013-0218 was discovered by Arun\nNeelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss\nEnterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.\n\nUsers of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 6.1.0.",
