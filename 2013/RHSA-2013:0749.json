				"text": "Apache CXF is an open source services framework.\n\nIt was found that the Apache CXF UsernameTokenPolicyValidator and\nUsernameTokenInterceptor allowed a UsernameToken element with no password\nchild element to bypass authentication. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to circumvent access controls applied to web services by omitting the\npassword in a UsernameToken. This flaw was exploitable on web services that\nrely on WS-SecurityPolicy plain text UsernameTokens to authenticate users.\nIt was not exploitable when using hashed passwords or WS-Security without\nWS-SecurityPolicy. (CVE-2013-0239)\n\nIf web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor\nenabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these\nservices were always granted access, without applying authentication\nchecks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing\nREST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple\nSOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints\napplied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if\nWSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that\nuse WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on\nJBoss Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration files, and\nany databases and database settings.\n\nAll users of JBoss Portal Platform 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update.",
