A remote attacker\nwith an authenticated session on an affected application could use this\nflaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not\npermitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.\n(CVE-2012-3546)\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise\nWeb Server installation (including all applications and configuration\nfiles).\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update.",
