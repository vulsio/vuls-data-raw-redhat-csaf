				"text": "Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the\nmanagement, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss BRMS\n5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security\nissues are also fixed with this release:\n\nXML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various\nframeworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use\ninsecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled\non endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as\nCVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be\nrecovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. This issue affected both the\nJBoss Web Services CXF (jbossws-cxf) and JBoss Web Services Native\n(jbossws-native) stacks. (CVE-2012-5575)\n\nIf you are using jbossws-cxf, then automatic checks to prevent this flaw\nare only run when WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security\nrequirements. It is best practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce\nsecurity requirements.\n\nIf you are using jbossws-native, the fix for this flaw is implemented by\ntwo new configuration parameters in the 'encryption' element. This element\ncan be a child of 'requires' in both client and server wsse configuration\ndescriptors (set on a per-application basis via the application's\njboss-wsse-server.xml and jboss-wsse-client.xml files). The new attributes\nare 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms'. These attributes should contain a\nblank space or comma separated list of algorithm IDs that are allowed for\nthe encrypted incoming message, both for encryption and private key\nwrapping. For backwards compatibility, no algorithm checks are performed by\ndefault for empty lists or missing attributes.\n\nFor example (do not include the line break in your configuration):\n\nencryption algorithms=\"aes-192-gcm aes-256-gcm\"\nkeyWrapAlgorithms=\"rsa_oaep\"\n\nSpecifies that incoming messages are required to be encrypted, and that the\nonly permitted encryption algorithms are AES-192 and 256 in GCM mode, and\nRSA-OAEP only for key wrapping.\n\nBefore performing any decryption, the jbossws-native stack will verify that\neach algorithm specified in the incoming messages is included in the\nallowed algorithms lists from these new encryption element attributes. The\nalgorithm values to be used for 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms' are\nthe same as for 'algorithm' and 'keyWrapAlgorithm' in the 'encrypt'\nelement.\n\nThe Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server\nhostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or\nsubjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a\nman-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate\nthat was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)\n\nMultiple weaknesses were found in the JBoss Web DIGEST authentication\nimplementation, effectively reducing the security normally provided by\nDIGEST authentication. A remote attacker could use these flaws to perform\nreplay attacks in some circumstances. (CVE-2012-5885, CVE-2012-5886,\nCVE-2012-5887)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj\nSomorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss\nBRMS installation (including its databases, applications, configuration\nfiles, and so on).\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to apply this roll up patch.",
