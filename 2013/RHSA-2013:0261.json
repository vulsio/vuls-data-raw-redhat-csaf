				"text": "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,\nwhich integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and\nJBoss Seam.\n\nAn attack technique was found against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when\nblock ciphers were used in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to conduct chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading\nto the recovery of the entire plain text of a particular cryptogram by\nexamining the differences between SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)\nresponses sent from JBoss Web Services. (CVE-2011-1096)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for\nreporting this issue.\n\nNote: Manual action is required to apply this update. The CVE-2011-1096\nissue is an attack on the WS-Security standard itself. Using new\nGalois/Counter Mode (GCM) based algorithms for WS-Security encryption is\nthe W3C suggested way of dealing with this issue. To use GCM algorithms in\nyour application, update the encrypt element of all jboss-ws-security\nconfiguration to specify a GCM algorithm. The following is an example\ndirective:\n\nencrypt type=\"x509v3\" algorithm=\"aes-128-gcm\" alias=\"wsse\"\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss\nEnterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications\nand configuration files).\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.",
