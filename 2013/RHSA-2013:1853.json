				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that\nprovides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss\nEnterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nThis JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0 release serves as a replacement for\nJBoss Operations Network 3.1.2, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to\nthe JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0 Release Notes for information on the\nmost significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a\nprotected resource could bypass the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nprevention filter. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform CSRF\nattacks against applications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter and do\nnot contain internal mitigation for CSRF. (CVE-2012-4431)\n\nThe Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server\nhostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or\nsubjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a\nman-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate\nthat was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java\nvalidated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an\narbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the\nSignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an\nXML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Operations\nNetwork installation (including its databases, applications, configuration\nfiles, the JBoss Operations Network server's file system directory, and so\non).\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0.",
