				"text": "JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business\nprocess automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for JBoss Enterprise SOA\nPlatform 5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security\nissues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIf web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor\nenabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these\nservices were always granted access, without applying authentication\nchecks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing\nREST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple\nSOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints\napplied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if\nWSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that\nuse WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)\n\nIt was found that Apache CXF was vulnerable to SOAPAction spoofing attacks\nunder certain conditions. If web services were exposed via Apache CXF that\nuse a unique SOAPAction for each service operation, then a remote attacker\ncould perform SOAPAction spoofing to call a forbidden operation if it\naccepts the same parameters as an allowed operation. WS-Policy validation\nwas performed against the operation being invoked, and an attack must pass\nvalidation to be successful. (CVE-2012-3451)\n\nMultiple weaknesses were found in the JBoss Web DIGEST authentication\nimplementation, effectively reducing the security normally provided by\nDIGEST authentication. A remote attacker could use these flaws to perform\nreplay attacks in some circumstances. (CVE-2012-5885, CVE-2012-5886,\nCVE-2012-5887)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting\nCVE-2012-3451.\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise\nSOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,\nconfiguration files, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.",
