				"text": "JBoss Web is a web container based on Apache Tomcat. It provides a single\ndeployment platform for the JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet\ntechnologies.\n\nIt was found that when an application used FORM authentication, along with\nanother component that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to\nFormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was\npossible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator\nby appending \"/j_security_check\" to the end of a URL. A remote attacker\nwith an authenticated session on an affected application could use this\nflaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not\npermitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.\n(CVE-2012-3546)\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss installation,\nincluding any databases, database settings, applications, configuration\nfiles, and so on.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 and JBoss Enterprise\nSOA Platform 5.3.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised\nto install this update.",
