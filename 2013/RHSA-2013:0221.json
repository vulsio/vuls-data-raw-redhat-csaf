				"text": "Security fixes:\n\nAn attack technique against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when block\nciphers were used in CBC mode could allow a remote attacker to conduct\nchosen-ciphertext attacks, leading to the recovery of the entire plain text\nof a particular cryptogram. (CVE-2011-1096)\n\nJBoss Web Services leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric\nkeys (for XML encryption), allowing a remote attacker to recover the entire\nplain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)\n\nSpring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)\nexpressions twice, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in\nthe context of the application server, or to obtain sensitive information\nfrom the server. Manual action is required to apply this fix. Refer to the\nSolution section. (CVE-2011-2730)\n\nWhen an application used FORM authentication, along with another component\nthat calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to\nFormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was\npossible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator\nby appending \"/j_security_check\" to the end of a URL. (CVE-2012-3546)\n\nAn XSS flaw allowed a remote attacker to perform an XSS attack against\nvictims using the JMX Console. (CVE-2011-4575)\n\nSecurityAssociation.getCredential() returned the previous credential if no\nsecurity context was provided. Depending on the deployed applications, this\ncould possibly allow a remote attacker to hijack the credentials of a\npreviously-authenticated user. (CVE-2012-3370)\n\nConfiguring the JMX Invoker to restrict access to users with specific roles\ndid not actually restrict access, allowing remote attackers with valid JMX\nInvoker credentials to perform JMX operations accessible to roles they are\nnot a member of. (CVE-2012-5478)\n\ntwiddle.sh accepted credentials as command line arguments, allowing local\nusers to view them via a process listing. (CVE-2009-5066)\n\nIt was found that NonManagedConnectionFactory would log the username and\npassword in plain text when an exception was thrown. This could lead to the\nexposure of authentication credentials if local users had permissions to\nread the log file. (CVE-2012-0034)\n\nThe JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow\nunauthenticated access by default in some profiles. The security\ninterceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation\nof this flaw. If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently\ndisabled, this flaw could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context\nof the user running the JBoss server. (CVE-2012-0874)\n\nCallerIdentityLoginModule retained the password from the previous call if a\nnull password was provided. In non-default configurations this could\npossibly lead to a remote attacker hijacking a previously-authenticated\nuser's session. (CVE-2012-3369)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for\nreporting CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487, and Tyler Krpata for reporting\nCVE-2011-4575. CVE-2012-3370 and CVE-2012-3369 were discovered by Carlo de\nWolf of Red Hat; CVE-2012-5478 discovered by Derek Horton of Red Hat; and\nCVE-2012-0874 was discovered by David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response\nTeam.",
