				"text": "The JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks\ninto a single solution for Java applications.\n\nThis release of JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0 serves as a replacement for\nJBoss Web Framework Kit 2.1.0. It includes various bug fixes and\nenhancements which are detailed in the JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0\nRelease Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/\n\nThis release also fixes the following security issues:\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the\nSYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a\nspecially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the\nApache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application\nhang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)\n\nNote: Seam and RichFaces used the xerces:xercesImpl:2.9.1-patch01 artifact,\nwhich is vulnerable to the CVE-2009-2625 flaw. In this release, the\nartifact has been replaced with xerces:xercesImpl:2.9.1-redhat-3, which is\nnot vulnerable.\n\nThe Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server\nhostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or\nsubjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a\nman-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate\nthat was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)\n\nNote: Jakarta Commons HttpClient 3 is vulnerable to CVE-2012-5783. Jakarta\nCommons HttpClient 3 has reached its end of life as an Apache-maintained\ncomponent, and no upstream build is available that addresses this flaw. The\nversion of Jakarta Commons HttpClient 3 that ships with JBoss Web Framework\nKit 2.2.0 includes a patch for this flaw, which has been built by Red Hat.\nVersions that are consumed from Maven Central do not have this patch\napplied.\n\nJakarta Commons HttpClient 3 is a transitive dependency for multiple\ncomponents included in JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0. If this dependency is\nresolved using a build of HttpClient 3 from Maven Central, then this flaw\nmay be exposed.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing installation of\nJBoss Enterprise Application Platform or JBoss Enterprise Web Server, and\napplications deployed to it.\n\nAll users of JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0.",
