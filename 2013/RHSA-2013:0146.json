				"text": "JBoss Web is the web container, based on Apache Tomcat, in JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform. It provides a single deployment platform for the\nJavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies.\n\nIt was found that when an application used FORM authentication, along with\nanother component that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to\nFormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was\npossible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator\nby appending \"/j_security_check\" to the end of a URL. A remote attacker\nwith an authenticated session on an affected application could use this\nflaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not\npermitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.\n(CVE-2012-3546)\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform's \"jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/\" directory, along\nwith all other customized configuration files.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.",
