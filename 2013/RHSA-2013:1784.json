				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java\napplications based on JBoss Application Server 7.\n\nThe HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name\nin /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no\ncustom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these\nnative libraries with malicious versions during the window between when\nHawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)\n\nA flaw was found in the way method-level authorization for JAX-WS Service\nendpoints was performed by the EJB invocation handler implementation.\nAny restrictions declared on EJB methods were ignored when executing the\nJAX-WS handlers, and only class-level restrictions were applied. A remote\nattacker who is authorized to access the EJB class, could invoke a JAX-WS\nhandler which they were not authorized to invoke. (CVE-2013-2133)\n\nThe CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat\nProduct Security Team, and the CVE-2013-2133 issue was discovered by\nRichard Opalka and Arun Neelicattu of Red Hat.\n\nThis release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform 6.1.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Documentation for\nthese changes will be available shortly from the JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 6.2.0 Release Notes, linked to in the References.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.0 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
