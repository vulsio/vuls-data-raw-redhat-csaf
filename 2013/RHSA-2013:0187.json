Refer to the JBoss ON 3.1.2 Release Notes for\ninformation on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes\nwill be available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Google Web Toolkit (GWT), a\ncore part of the JBoss ON web interface. If a remote attacker could trick a\nuser, who was logged into the JBoss ON web interface, into visiting a\nspecially-crafted URL, it could possibly lead to arbitrary web script\nexecution in the context of the user's JBoss ON session. (CVE-2012-5920)\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON\ninstallation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,\nthe JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2.",
