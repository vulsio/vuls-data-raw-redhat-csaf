JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality.\n\nIt was found that when an application used FORM authentication, along with\nanother component that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to\nFormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was\npossible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator\nby appending \"/j_security_check\" to the end of a URL. A remote attacker\nwith an authenticated session on an affected application could use this\nflaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not\npermitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.\n(CVE-2012-3546)\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise\nSOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,\nconfiguration files, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0.CP05 and 4.3.0.CP05 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.",
