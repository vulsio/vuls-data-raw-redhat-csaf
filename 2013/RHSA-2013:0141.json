If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the\nGateIn Portal interface, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would\nlead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's GateIn\nPortal session. (CVE-2012-5531)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Hideharu Ohkuma of Ricoh Company for reporting\nthese issues.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on\nJBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration\nfiles, and any databases and database settings.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.",
