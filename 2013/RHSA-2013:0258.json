				"text": "The Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss\nEnterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light\nand rich Java applications.\n\nIf web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor\nenabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these\nservices were always granted access, without applying authentication\nchecks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing\nREST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple\nSOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints\napplied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if\nWSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that\nuse WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)\n\nIt was found that Apache CXF was vulnerable to SOAPAction spoofing attacks\nunder certain conditions. If web services were exposed via Apache CXF that\nuse a unique SOAPAction for each service operation, then a remote attacker\ncould perform SOAPAction spoofing to call a forbidden operation if it\naccepts the same parameters as an allowed operation. WS-Policy validation\nwas performed against the operation being invoked, and an attack must pass\nvalidation to be successful. (CVE-2012-3451)\n\nNote that the CVE-2012-3451 and CVE-2012-5633 issues only affected\nenvironments that have JBoss Web Services CXF installed.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting\nCVE-2012-3451.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss\nEnterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications\nand configuration files).\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.",
