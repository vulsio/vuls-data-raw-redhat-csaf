				"text": "Red Hat provides a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest Image for\ncloud instances. This image is provided as a minimally configured system\nimage which is available for use as-is or for configuration and\ncustomization as required by end users.\n\nThe Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest Image for cloud instances had an\nempty root password by default. To address this, Red Hat has created an\nupdated image that locks the root password by default. This updated image\nis now available on RHN.\n\nTo correct existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest Images, any\nimages or systems built using this Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest\nImage, or any currently running Red Hat Enterprise Linux instances\ninstantiated from this image, users can lock the root password by issuing,\nas root, the command:\n\npasswd -l root\n\nNote: The default OpenSSH configuration disallows password logins when\nthe password is empty, preventing a remote attacker from logging in\nwithout a password.\n\nRoot Cause\n\nKickstart can be used to automate operating system installations. A\nKickstart file specifies settings for an installation. Once the\ninstallation system boots, it can read a Kickstart file and carry out the\ninstallation process without any further input from a user. Kickstart is\nused as part of the process of creating Images of Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nfor cloud providers.\n\nIt was discovered that when no 'rootpw' command was specified in a\nKickstart file, the image creator tools gave the root user an empty\npassword rather than leaving the password locked, which could allow a local\nuser to gain access to the root account (CVE-2013-2069).\n\nWe have corrected this issue by updating the Kickstart file used to build\naffected images to lock the password file.\n\nThis issue was caused by the way a tool was used to create Images, and not\ndue to a security vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nTo import the image into an OpenStack environment, download the image from\nRed Hat Network to a system that has the python-glanceclient package\ninstalled. Refer to the OpenStack Getting Started Guide, linked to in the\nReferences, for information on importing the image into an OpenStack\nenvironment. After successfully importing, it is also highly recommended\nthat the \"glance delete\" command is used to delete any previous versions of\nthe image that exist in the Glance image registry.",
