				"text": "An update for the Apache HTTP Server component of Red Hat JBoss Web Server\n2.0.1 that fixes two security issues is now available from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, Solaris, and\nMicrosoft Windows.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate\nsecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.",

				"text": "Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of\ncomponents for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache\nHTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector\n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat\nNative library.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server\nhandled merge requests. An attacker could use this flaw to send a crafted\nmerge request that contains URIs that are not configured for DAV, causing\nthe httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2013-1896)\n\nIt was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from\nits log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive,\na remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject\nterminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed\nthe log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command\nexecution with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-1862)\n\nNote: CVE-2013-1862 affects mod_rewrite. In the process of testing this\npatch, it was found that enabling mod_rewrite on 64-bit versions of Windows\nServer 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 running Red Hat JBoss Web Server\n2.0.1 could cause an httpd thread to crash, and the httpd process to\nrestart. This bug is present in the GA release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server\n2.0.1, and is not a regression introduced by this patch. This bug may be\nresolved in a future update to JBoss Web Server 2.\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss\nWeb Server installation (including all applications and configuration\nfiles).\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update.",
