When parsing the results of the DNS\nquery, nss_ldap does not check that data returned by the server will fit\ninto an internal buffer, leaving it vulnerable to a buffer overflow\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0825 to this issue.\n\nWhen versions of nss_ldap prior to nss_ldap-199 are configured without a\nvalue for the \"host\" setting, nss_ldap will attempt to configure itself by\nusing SRV records stored in DNS. When parsing the results of the DNS\nquery, nss_ldap does not check that the data returned has not been\ntruncated by the resolver libraries to avoid a buffer overflow, and may\nattempt to parse more data than is actually available, leaving it\nvulnerable to a read buffer overflow.\n\nVersions of pam_ldap prior to version 144 include a format string bug in\nthe logging function. The packages included in this erratum update pam_ldap\nto version 144, fixing this bug.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject has assigned the name CAN-2002-0374 to this issue.\n\nAll users of nss_ldap should update to these errata packages which are not\nvulnerable to the above issues. These packages are based on nss_ldap-189\nwith the addition of a backported security patch and pam_ldap version 144.\n\nThanks to the nss_ldap and pam_ldap team at padl.com for providing\ninformation about these issues.",
