This kernel addresses the\nvulnerability.  \n\nNote: This bug is specific to the x86 architecture kernels only, and does\nnot affect ia64 or other architectures.\n\nIn addition, /proc/tty/driver/serial reveals the exact number of\ncharacters used in serial links, which could allow local users to obtain\npotentially sensitive information such as password lengths.\n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which are not vulnerable\nto these issues.\n\nThanks go to Christopher Devine for reporting the vulnerability on Bugtraq,\nand Petr Vandrovec for being the first to supply a fix to the community.",
