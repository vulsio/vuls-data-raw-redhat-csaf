We\nare grateful to Matthew Caron for pointing out this configuration\nproblem.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0378 to this issue.\n\nThe updated packages from this advisory change the job submission\npolicy (in /etc/lpd.perms) so that jobs from remote hosts are refused\nby default.\n\nThose running print servers may want to adjust this policy as\nappropriate, for example to give access to certain hosts or subnets.\nFor details on how to do this, see the lpd.perms(5) man page.\n\nPlease note that default installations of Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1\ninclude ipchains rules blocking remote access to the print spooler IP port;\nas a result those installations already reject remote job submissions.   \n\nNOTE: There are special instructions for installing this update at\nthe end of the \"Solution\" section.",
