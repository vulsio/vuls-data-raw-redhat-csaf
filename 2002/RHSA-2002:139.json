				"text": "The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by\nmultiple programs on the system.\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the way the glibc\nresolver handles the resolution of network names and addresses via DNS (as\nper Internet RFC 1011).  Version 2.2.5 of glibc and earlier versions are\naffected.  A system would be vulnerable to this issue if the\n\"networks\" database in /etc/nsswitch.conf includes the \"dns\" entry.  By\ndefault, Red Hat Linux ships with \"networks\" set to \"files\" and\nis therefore not vulnerable to this issue.  (CAN-2002-0684)\n\nA second, related, issue is a bug in the glibc-compat packages,  which\nprovide compatibility for applications compiled against glibc version\n2.0.x.  Applications compiled against this version (such as those\ndistributed with early Red Hat Linux releases 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2) could also\nbe vulnerable to this issue.  (CAN-2002-0651)\n\nThese errata packages for Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2 on the Itanium\narchitecture also include a fix for the strncpy implementation in some\nboundary cases.\n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain patches to\nthe glibc and glibc-compat libraries and therefore are not vulnerable to\nthese issues.",
