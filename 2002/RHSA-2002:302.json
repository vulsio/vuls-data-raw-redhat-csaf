Georgi Guninski found that\nthese comments can be carefully crafted in order to call external programs.\n This could allow an attacker to create a text file such that when it is\nopened arbitrary commands are executed.   \n\nUsers of VIM are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which have \nbeen patched to disable the usage of dangerous funtions in modelines.",
