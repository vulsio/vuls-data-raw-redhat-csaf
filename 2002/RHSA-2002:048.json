				"text": "Imlib versions prior to 1.9.13 would fall back to loading images\nvia the NetPBM package, which has various problems making it\nunsuitable for loading untrusted images. Imlib 1.9.13 also fixes\nvarious problems in arguments passed to malloc().\n\nThese problems may allow attackers to construct images that,\nwhen loaded by a viewer using Imlib, could cause crashes \nor potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain Imlib 1.9.13.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2002-0167, CAN-2002-0168 to these issues.\n\n[update May 16 2002]\nThe previous release of this errata fixed the aforementioned security\nproblems but had a file descriptor leak and a bug which would cause some\napplications (such as the Enlightenment window manager) to hang. These\nupdated packages fix these issues.",
