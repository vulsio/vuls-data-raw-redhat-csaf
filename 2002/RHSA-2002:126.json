On some platforms this can be remotely\nexploited -- allowing arbitrary code to be run on the server.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\n\nAll users of Apache should update to these errata packages to correct this\nsecurity issue.",
