Since ghostscript is often used\nduring the course of printing a document (and is run as user 'lp'), all\nusers should install these fixed packages.\n\nThe problem is fixed in the 6.53 source release of GNU Ghostscript, and the\nfix has been backported and applied to the packages referenced by this\nadvisory.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0363 to this issue.\n\nPlease note that this vulnerability is different to the 'local file read'\nissue corrected by our previous Ghostscript errata (RHSA-2001:112 and\nRHSA-2001:138)",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
