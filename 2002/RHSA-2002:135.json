				"text": "The mod_ssl module provides strong cryptography for the Apache Web\nserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security\n(TLS) protocols.  Versions of mod_ssl prior to 2.8.10 are subject to a\nsingle NULL overflow that can cause arbitrary code execution.\n\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, the Apache Web server has to be\nconfigured to allow overriding of configuration settings on a per-directory\nbasis, and untrusted local users must be able to modify a directory in\nwhich the server is configured to allow overriding.  The local attacker may\nthen become the user that Apache is running as (usually 'www' or 'nobody').  \n\nNote that regardless of this bug, local users can obtain the same\nprivileges if the server is configured to allow them to create CGI scripts\nwhich run as the Web server user, or if PHP is enabled but not configured\nin \"safe mode.\"\n\nThe errata packages contain versions of mod_ssl that have been patched and\nare not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nPlease note that you must restart the httpsd service to use the updated\nmodule. For instructions on doing this, see the bottom of the Solutions\nsection below.",
