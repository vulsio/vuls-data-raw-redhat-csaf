				"text": "PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system\n(DBMS).  Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1 shipped with PostgreSQL version\n7.1.3 which has several security vulnerabilities.  \n\nBuffer overflows in PostgreSQL 7.2 allow attackers to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly execute arbitrary code via long arguments to the lpad\nor rpad functions. CAN-2002-0972\n\nBuffer overflow in the cash_words() function for PostgreSQL 7.2 and\nearlier allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code via a malformed argument.  CAN-2002-1397\n\nBuffer overflow in the date parser for PostgreSQL before 7.2.2 allows\nattackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode via a long date string, referred to as a vulnerability \"in handling\nlong datetime input.\"  CAN-2002-1398\n\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the repeat() function for PostgreSQL\nbefore 7.2.2 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by causing\nrepeat() to generate a large string.  CAN-2002-1400\n\nBuffer overflows in circle_poly, path_encode, and path_add allow attackers\nto cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.   Note\nthat these issues have been fixed in our packages and in PostgreSQL CVS,\nbut are not included in PostgreSQL version 7.2.2 or 7.2.3.  CAN-2002-1401\n\nBuffer overflows in the TZ and SET TIME ZONE enivronment variables for\nPostgreSQL 7.2.1 and earlier allow local users to cause a denial of service\nand possibly execute arbitrary code.  CAN-2002-1402\n\nNote that these vulnerabilities are only critical on open or shared systems\nbecause connecting to the database is required before the vulnerabilities\ncan be exploited.\n\nThe PostgreSQL Global Development Team has released versions of PostgreSQL\nthat fix these vulnerabilities, and these fixes have been isolated and\nbackported into the updated 7.1.3 packages provided with this errata.\nAll users of Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1 who use PostgreSQL are\nadvised to install these updated packages.",
