It provides the ability to limit the set of executable programs\navailable to Sendmail.\n\nA bug in the version of smrsh packaged as part of Sendmail 8.12.6 and\n8.11.6 allows attackers to bypass shrsh's intended restrictions.  This\ncan be done by inserting additional commands after \"||\" or \"/\" characters,\nwhich are not properly filtered or verified.  A sucessful attack would\nallow an attacker who has a local account on a system to execute arbitrary\nbinaries as themselves by utilizing their .forward file.\n\nBecause sendmail as shipped with Red Hat Linux Advanced Server is not\nconfigured to use smrsh, this issue only affects users who have customized\ntheir sendmail configuration to use smrsh.\n\nUsers who have configured sendmail to use smrsh should update to these\nerrata packages which contain a backported security fix, and are therefore\nnot vulnerable to this issue.",
