				"category": "general",
				"text": "ISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS \n(Domain Name System) protocols.  BIND includes a DNS server (named) --\nwhich resolves hostnames to IP addresses, a resolver library\n(routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS), and\nvarious tools.\n\nVersions of BIND 9 prior to 9.2.1 have a bug that causes certain requests\nto the BIND name server to fail an internal consistency check, causing the\nname server to stop responding to requests.  This can be used by a remote\nattacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack against name servers. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0400 to this issue.\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of DNS\nresolver libraries. Applications that utilize vulnerable DNS resolver\nlibraries may be affected. A remote attacker who is able to send malicious\nDNS responses could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute\narbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) attack on a vulnerable\nsystem. Red Hat Linux does not ship with any applications or libraries that\nlink against the BIND resolver libraries; however, third party code may be\naffected. (CAN-2002-0651)\n\nRed Hat Linux Advanced Server shipped with a version of ISC BIND vulnerable\nto both of these issues.  All users of BIND are advised to upgrade to the\nerrata packages containing BIND 9.2.1 which contains backported patches\nthat correct these issues.",
