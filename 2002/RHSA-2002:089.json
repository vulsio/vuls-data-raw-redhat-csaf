				"text": "With its default configuration, LPRng will accept job submissions from\nany host, which is not appropriate in a workstation environment.  We\nare grateful to Matthew Caron for pointing out this configuration\nproblem.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0378 to this issue.\n\nThe updated packages from this advisory change the job submission\npolicy (in /etc/lpd.perms) so that jobs from remote hosts are refused\nby default.\n\nThose running print servers may want to adjust this policy as\nappropriate, for example to give access to certain hosts or subnets.\nFor details on how to do this see the lpd.perms(5) man page.\n\nSince Red Hat Linux 7.1, default installations include ipchains rules\nblocking remote access to the print spooler IP port; as a result those\ninstallations already reject remote job submissions.  However, Red Hat\nLinux 7 machines and any machine upgraded to a later release (as \nopposed to\nhaving been freshly installed) will not have ipchains rules in place\nby default.\n\nIMPORTANT: There are special instructions for installing this update at\nthe end of the \"Solution\" section below.",

To use Red Hat \nNetwork,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the \nappropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nAfter upgrading, you should check that the new configuration file is\nactivated. To  do this, type the following command:\n\ngrep \"X NOT SERVER\" /etc/lpd.perms\n\nIf this commad returns no output, you will need to put the new\nconfiguration file in place by typing:\n\nmv /etc/lpd.perms.rpmnew /etc/lpd.perms",
