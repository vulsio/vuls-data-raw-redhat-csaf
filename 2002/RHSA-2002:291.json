Several security issues have been found in the Ethereal packages\ndistributed with Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1.\n\nMultiple errors involving signed integers in the BGP dissector in Ethereal\n0.9.7 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n(infinite loop) via malformed messages. This problem was discovered by\nSilvio Cesare. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1355 to this issue.\n\nEthereal 0.9.7 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial\nof service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via malformed\npackets to the LMP, PPP, or TDS dissectors. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1356 to\nthis issue.\n\nUsers of Ethereal should update to the errata packages containing Ethereal\nversion 0.9.8 which is not vulnerable to these issues.",
