				"text": "Versions of the Apache Web server up to and including 1.3.24 contain a bug\nin the routines which deal with \"chunked\" encoded requests.\nA carefully crafted invalid request can cause an Apache child process to\ncall the memcpy() function in a way that will write past the end of its\nbuffer, corrupting the stack.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\n\nDue to the nature of the overflow on 32-bit Unix platforms, this will most\nlikely cause a segmentation violation, and the child will terminate. \nHowever, on some 64-bit and 32-bit platforms, an additional exploit may be\npossible. On these platforms, the overflow could allow arbitrary code to be\nrun on the server, with the code running as the user under which the Apache\nchild processes are set to run.\n\nAll users of Stronghold are advised to upgrade to this errata release.",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
