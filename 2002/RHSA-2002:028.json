				"text": "The Linux Netfilter team has found a problem in the IRC connection\ntracking component of the firewall within the linux kernel. This component\nis distributed with kernels in Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2, although it is\nnot used in default installations.\n\nThe problem consists of an excessively broad netmask setting which is\napplied to check if an \"IRC DCC\" connection through a masquerading firewall\nshould be allowed. This results in unwanted ports being opened on the\nfirewall, which could, depending on the firewall filter ruleset, allow\ninbound connections.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0060 to this issue.  Thanks to Jozsef Kadlecsik\nand Harald Welte of the netfilter team.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this errata kernel containing patches\nwhich fix these issues.",

Many\npeople find this to be an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat\nNetwork, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system. Note that you need to select the kernel\nexplicitly on default configurations of up2date.\n\nNote for customers using Red Hat Linux for the IBM s/390:\n\nUsers of Red Hat Linux for the IBM s/390 with binary only kernel modules\n(OCO) should contact their vendor to obtain updated modules for this kernel\npatch.",
