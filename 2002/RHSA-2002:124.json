Because XChat resolves hostnames by\npassing the configured resolver and hostname to a shell, an IRC server may\nreturn a maliciously formatted response that executes arbitrary commands\nwith the privileges of the user running XChat.\n\nAll users of XChat are advised to update to these errata packages\ncontaining XChat version 1.8.9 which is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\n[update 14 Aug 2002]\nPrevious packages pushed were not signed, this update replaces the packages\nwith signed versions",
