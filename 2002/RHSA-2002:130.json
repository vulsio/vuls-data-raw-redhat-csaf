The following summary\ndescribes the various issues found and fixed:\n\nSeveral buffer overflows have been found in the MSTN auth helper\n(msnt_auth) when configured to use denyusers or allowusers access control\nfiles.\n\nSeveral buffer overflows were found in the gopher client of Squid. It\ncould be possible for a malicious gopher server to cause Squid to crash.\n\nA problem was found in the handling of the FTP data channel, possibly\nallowing abuse of the FTP proxy to bypass firewall rules or inject false\nFTP replies.\n\nSeveral possible buffer overflows were found in the code parsing FTP\ndirectories, which potentially allow for an untrusted FTP server to crash\nSquid.\n\nThanks go to Olaf Kirch and the Squid team for notifying us of the\nproblems and to the Squid team for providing patches.\n\nAll users of Squid are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain patches to correct each of these issues.",
