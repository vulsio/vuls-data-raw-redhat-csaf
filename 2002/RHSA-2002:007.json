				"text": "Larry McVoy has discovered a problem in the CIPE (VPN tunnel)\nimplementation where a malformed packet could cause a crash. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2002-0047 to this issue.\n\nAndrew Griffiths has discovered a vulnerability that allows remote machines\nto read random memory using a bug in the Linux ICMP implementation.\nHowever, 2.4 kernels after version 2.4.0-test6 and 2.2 kernels after\nversion 2.2.18 fix this issue. All Red Hat Linux 2.4 kernels have this\nfix and are not vulnerable to this bug.\n\nIt is recommended that users running older 2.2 kernels on Red Hat Linux 6.2\nor 7 upgrade to the latest available errata kernel, which includes a fix\nfor this problem.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0046 to this issue.\n\nA patch for recent 2.4 kernels is circulating to fix the bug in the Linux\nICMP implementation. Red Hat, Inc. recommends that you do not use this\npatch since Red Hat Linux 2.4 kernels are not vulnerable to the bug and the\npatch will actually break the kernel ICMP implementation.\n\nIn addition to the CIPE security fix, several other bugs were fixed, and\nsome drivers were updated:\n\n* For Red Hat Linux 7.1: DRM/DRI (3D support) for the XFree86 erratum\n  RHEA-2002:010\n* New aacraid driver rewritten by Alan Cox\n* New DAC960 driver\n* Additional Qlogic 2200 driver \n* LM_Sensors driver upgrade\n\nPlease note the additional procedures in the \"Solutions\" section as they\ndiffer from standard update procedures.",
