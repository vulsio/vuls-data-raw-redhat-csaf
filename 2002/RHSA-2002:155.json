				"text": "OpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit which\nimplements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose\ncryptography library. A security audit of the OpenSSL code sponsored by\nDARPA found several buffer overflows in OpenSSL which affect versions 0.9.7\nand 0.9.6d and earlier:\n\n1. The master key supplied by a client to an SSL version 2 server could be\noversized, causing a stack-based buffer overflow. This issue is remotely\nexploitable. Services that have SSLv2 disabled would not be vulnerable to\nthis issue. (CAN-2002-0656)\n\n2. The SSLv3 session ID supplied to a client from a malicious server could\nbe oversized and overrun a buffer. This issue looks to be remotely\nexploitable. (CAN-2002-0656)\n\n3. Various buffers used for storing ASCII representations of integers were\ntoo small on 64 bit platforms. This issue may be exploitable. (CAN-2002-0655)\n\nA further issue was found in OpenSSL 0.9.7 that does not affect versions of\nOpenSSL shipped with Red Hat Linux (CAN-2002-0657).\n\nA large number of applications within Red Hat Linux make use the OpenSSL\nlibrary to provide SSL support.  All users are therefore advised to upgrade\nto the errata OpenSSL packages, which contain patches to correct these\nvulnerabilities.\n\nNOTE: \n\nPlease read the Solution section below as it contains instructions for\nmaking sure that all SSL-enabled processes are restarted after the update\nis applied.\n\nThanks go to the OpenSSL team and Ben Laurie for providing patches for\nthese issues.",
