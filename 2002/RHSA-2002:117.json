				"text": "Versions of the Apache Web server up to and including 1.3.24 contain a bug\nin the routines which deal with requests that are processed with \"chunked\"\nencoding. A carefully crafted invalid request can cause an Apache child\nprocess to call the memcpy() function in a way that will write past the end\nof its buffer, corrupting the stack.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\n\nOur investigations show that this bug cannot be used to gain remote access\nto a server running Red Hat Secure Web Server, but it does cause the child\nprocess to die. The Apache parent process will notice this and start a new\nchild process when necessary -- using slightly more resources than normal.  \n\nAll users of Secure Web Server should update to these errata packages to\ncorrect this security issue.  \n\nNOTE: Pay special attention to the installation instructions in the\n\"Solution\" section below as they differ from standard upgrade instructions.",
