Since GNU Ghostscript is often used\nduring the course of printing a document (and is run as user 'lp'), all\nusers should install these fixed packages.\n\nThe problem is fixed in the 6.53 source release of GNU Ghostscript, and the\nfix has been backported and applied to the packages referenced by this\nadvisory.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0363 to this issue.",
