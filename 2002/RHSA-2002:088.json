Several security issues have been found in Ethereal:\n\nDue to improper string and error handling in Ethereal's ASN.1 parser, it is\npossible for a malformed SNMP or LDAP packet to cause a memory allocation\nor buffer overrun error in Ethereal versions before 0.9.2 (CAN-2002-0013\nCAN-2002-0012)\n\nThe ASN.1 parser in Ethereal 0.9.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) via a certain malformed packet, which\ncauses Ethereal to allocate memory incorrectly, possibly due to zero-length\nfields. (CAN-2002-0353)\n\nThe SMB dissector in Ethereal prior to version 0.9.2 allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code\nvia malformed packets that cause Ethereal to dereference a NULL pointer.\n(CAN-2002-0401)\n\nA buffer overflow in X11 dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code while Ethereal is parsing keysyms. (CAN-2002-0402)\n\nThe DNS dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed packet\nthat causes Ethereal to enter an infinite loop. (CAN-2002-0403)\n\nA vulnerability in GIOP dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). (CAN-2002-0404)\n\nUsers of Ethereal should update to the errata packages containing Ethereal\nversion 0.9.4 which is not vulnerable to these issues.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.",
