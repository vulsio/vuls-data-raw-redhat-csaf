Each of\nthese flaws could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the remote\nsystem.\n\nPHP 3.10-3.18 contains a broken boundary check (hard to exploit) and an\narbitrary heap overflow (easy to exploit).  These versions of PHP were\nshipped with Red Hat Linux 6.2.\n   \nPHP 4.0.1-4.0.3pl1 contains a broken boundary check (hard to exploit) and a\nheap-off-by-one (easy to exploit).  These versions of PHP were shipped with \nRed Hat Linux 7.0.\n\nPHP 4.0.2-4.0.5 contains two broken boundary checks (one very easy and one\nhard to exploit).  These versions of PHP were shipped with Red Hat Linux\n7.1 and as erratas to 7.0.\n\nPHP 4.0.6-4.0.7RC2 contains a broken boundary check (very easy to exploit).\nThese versions of PHP were shipped with Red Hat Linux 7.2\n      \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0081 to this issue.\n\nIf you are running PHP 4.0.3 or above, one way to work around these bugs is\nto disable the fileupload support within your php.ini file (by setting\nfile_uploads = Off).\n\nAll users of PHP are advised to immediately upgrade to these errata\npackages which close these vulnerabilities.\n\nA previous version of this erratum included a version of the MySQL\nextension which was compiled with an incorrect default pathname for the\nsocket used to connect to database servers residing on the local host.\n\nThis setting corresponds to the mysql.default_socket setting in the\n/etc/php.ini file, and can also be corrected there.",
