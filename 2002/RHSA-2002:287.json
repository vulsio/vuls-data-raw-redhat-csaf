				"text": "VNC is a tool for providing a remote graphical user interface.\n\nThe VNC DES authentication scheme is implemented using a challenge-response\narchitecture, producing a random and different challenge for each\nauthentication attempt.\n\nA bug in the function for generating the random challenge caused the random\nseed to be reset to the current time on every authentication attempt.\nAs a result, two authentication attempts within the same second could\nreceive the same challenge. An eavesdropper could exploit this\nvulnerability by replaying the response, thereby gaining authentication.\n\nAll users of VNC are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain an updated version and are not vulnerable to this issue. \n\nNote that when using VNC on an untrusted network, always make sure to\ntunnel the VNC protocol through a secure, authenticated channel such as\nSSH.  Instructions on how to tunnel VNC through SSH are provided at the\nfollowing URL: http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/sshvnc.html",
